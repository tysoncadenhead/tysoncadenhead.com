If you aren&#39;t careful, you can make some pretty ugly nested code in order to get things to work like you expect. To solve the problem of illegible nested callbacks, we have promises. If you are writing applications in Angular, you are in luck because Angular ships with a great promise library called &quot;Q&quot;. Today, we&#39;re going to look at a few approaches to making more readable and maintainable Angular applications with the help of the built in Q promise library.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/54391964.jpg\" width=\"50%\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>What Are Promises?</h3><p>In the distant past, I have been guilty of writing things like this:</p>\n<pre><code>myModels.getPerson({ id: 1 }, function (person) {\n   myModels.getDad(person, function (dad) {\n        myModels.getPet(dad, function (pet) {\n            myModels.getPetColor(pet, function (color) {\n                // ...\n            });\n        });\n   });\n});\n</code></pre><p>It looks really ugly, but there were instances where I needed to make one asynchronous operation, then based on the data that I got back from the operation, I would need to make another operation and the tunnel of madness would begin. Promises are an answer to that problem.</p>\n<p>Whether you know it or not, you&#39;ve probably been exposed to promises inside of libraries like jQuery when you tack a <code>then()</code> method on after a function.</p>\n<p>The way it works is that the function returns a &quot;promise&quot; instead of a result. Inside the function, the promise can be resolved at some point and the <code>then()</code> method is fired which continues the chain of methods you are building.</p>\n<p>Taking our contrived example above, if we were using promises, it might look more like this:</p>\n<pre><code>myModels\n    .getPerson({\n        id: 1\n    })\n    .then(myModels.getDad)\n    .then(myModels.getPet)\n    .then(myModels.getPetColor)\n    .done(function (data) {\n        // ...\n    });\n</code></pre><p>Now we&#39;ve got an API that is readable and maintainable. Life is good again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.quickmeme.com/img/01/015f8f78101fcf7e97a3b9492a1aee81f7ed3958b5356eee14cf8391a98d2888.jpg\" width=\"50%\" /></p>\n<h3>What Is <code>Q</code>?</h3><p>There are numerous promise libraries out there, but Angular ships with one called <a href=\"https://github.com/kriskowal/q\">Q</a>. It is a really nice library and I&#39;ve used it for some of my non-Angular and even some of my Node projects in the past. Angular can inject <code>$q</code> directly, but some of the services, such as the <code>$resource</code> service already use it under the hood.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ct.fra.bz/ol/fz/sw/i59/5/9/27/frabz-One-does-Not-Simply-give-a-promise-then-pretend-it-never-happen-2d0ebe.jpg\" width=\"50%\" /></p>\n<h3>Deferring A Promise</h3><p>The syntax for deferring a promise is pretty straightforward. You need to instantiate a new <code>$q.defer()</code> and then return the promise off of the object that it returns. When you&#39;re done doing what you&#39;re doing, you just need to resolve the deferred object. If you have any data that you want to pass into the resolve function, you can pass it as the first argument.</p>\n<pre><code>angular\n    .module(&#39;myApp&#39;)\n    .service(&#39;Wait&#39;, Wait);\n\nWait.$inject = [&#39;$q&#39;, &#39;$window&#39;];\n\nfunction Wait ($q, $window) {\n\n    var service = {};\n\n    service.waitFor = waitFor;\n\n    function waitFor (ms) {\n        var deferred = $q.defer();\n\n        $window.setTimeout(function () {\n            deferred.resolve();\n        }, ms);\n\n        return deferred.promise;\n    }\n\n    return service;\n\n}\n</code></pre><p>The service above could be used like this:</p>\n<pre><code>angular\n    .module(&#39;myApp&#39;)\n    .controller(&#39;MyController&#39;, MyController);\n\nMyController.$inject = [&#39;Wait&#39;];\n\nfunction MyController (Wait) {\n    Wait\n        .waitFor(1000)\n        .then(function () {\n            alerted(&#39;I already waited for a second! I\\&#39;m bored!&#39;);\n        });\n}\n</code></pre><p><img src=\"http://djebbz.github.io/async-paris-js/images/why-so-asynchronous.jpg\" width=\"50%\" /></p>\n<h3>Waiting For Multiple Promises</h3><p>Sometimes, you have multiple promise you want to resolve, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily matter what order the functions are executed in. You just want to execute multiple asynchronous operations and get notified when they are done. For that, we have <code>$q.all</code>. The &quot;all&quot; method takes an array of functions and gives you a callback when they are all completed.</p>\n<p>Using <code>$q.all</code> looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>angular\n    .module(&#39;myApp&#39;)\n    .controller(&#39;MyController&#39;, MyController);\n\nMyController.$inject = [&#39;$q&#39;, &#39;$window&#39;];\n\nfunction MyController ($q, $window) {\n\n    $q.all([\n        $q(firstThing()),\n        $q(firstSecond()),\n        $q(thirdThing())\n    ])\n    .then(function (data) {\n        // ...\n    });\n\n    function firstThing () {\n        var deferred = $q.defer();\n\n        $window\n            .setTimeout(deferred.resolve, 1000);\n\n        return deferred.promise;\n    }\n\n    function secondThing () {\n        var deferred = $q.defer();\n\n        $window\n            .setTimeout(deferred.resolve, 2000);\n\n        return deferred.promise;\n    }\n\n    function thirdThing () {\n        var deferred = $q.defer();\n\n        $window\n            .setTimeout(deferred.resolve, 3000);\n\n        return deferred.promise;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre><p>Note that the each function you are passing into the array that is the first argument of <code>$q.all</code> method needs to be wrapped in a <code>$q</code>. That might seem a little tedious, but it keeps the functions from executing without a proper callback and in turn breaking the chain.</p>\n<p>There might be a little learning curve with Angular promises, but it is well worth the effort. Promises can go a long way to make cleaner more maintainable code and I&#39;ve found that the implementation in Angular is very solid.</p>\n"},"angular-controller-as":{"published":true,"title":"Ditching $scope For ControllerAs In Angular Apps","tags":["angular"],"category":"code","date":"11/29/2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/angular-controller-as.jpeg","yield":"<p>At the ng-europe conference in Paris this year, the Angular team made several revelations about what Angular 2.0 will look like once it is complete. Several of the current features of Angular will be put to rest, but one of the more notable ones is the controller <code>$scope</code>. As developers prepare to eventually migrate their applications to Angular 2.0, it is important to do what we can currently in order to prepare for the easiest migration. One thing we already know we can do is to stop using the angular $scope entirely in our controllers. This is how you can do exactly that.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h3>What&#39;s Wrong With <code>$scope</code>?</h3><p>The current implementation of the Angular $scope is an artifact of the earlier days of Angular when many of the big questions about how to build high-quality single page applications were still being figured out and debated. The issue with injecting a <code>$scope</code> into a controller is that the there is no way to distinguish where a parameter is coming from in a template. Take this as an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">&lt;div ng-controller=&quot;MyFirstController&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div ng-controller=&quot;MySecondController&quot;&gt;\n        {{myProperty}}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the example above, there is no way to determine whether the first controller or the second controller sets the <code>myProperty</code> binding. It could actually be either one, since the scope is inherited up the chain.</p>\n<p>Because of the ambiguity along with the unnecessary verbosity of creating a unique scope inside of every controller, as the Angular 2.0 project has been progressing, it has been determined that a much better approach is to treat the controller itself as the scope.</p>\n<h3>What Can I Do To Stop Using <code>$scope</code>?</h3><p>Fortunately, we can already stop injecting a <code>$scope</code> into our controllers by using the <code>controllerAs</code> syntax in the current version of Angular. The controllerAs syntax is fairly straightforward and will probably look more familiar to developers who cut their teeth in traditional object oriented JavaScript before learning Angular. When we use <code>controllerAs</code>, <code>this</code> becomes what we would refer to as the scope of the controller.</p>\n<p>That means that instead of this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">angular\n    .module(&#39;myApp&#39;)\n    .controller(&#39;MyFirstController&#39;, MyFirstController);\n\nMyFirstController.$inject = [&#39;$scope&#39;];\n\nfunction MyFirstController ($scope) {\n    $scope.myAttr = &#39;myAttribute&#39;;\n    $scope.myMethod = function () {}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A controller would look more like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">angular\n    .module(&#39;myApp&#39;)\n    .controller(&#39;MyFirstController&#39;, MyFirstController);\n\nMyFirstController.$inject = [];\n\nfunction MyFirstController () {\n    var vm = this;\n    vm.myAttr = &#39;myAttribute&#39;;\n    vm.myMethod = function () {}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Okay, But How Do I Bind That?</h3><p>Ultimately, you&#39;ll want to try to bind your controllers outside of your the template that is bound to. That way, you could reuse templates as needed. I won&#39;t be doing that in this example, because everything is in a single template, but I just wanted to make that clear. To bind your new controller, you&#39;ll just need to do something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">&lt;div ng-controller=&quot;MyFirstController as myFirstCtrl&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div ng-click=&quot;myFirstCtrl.myMethod()&quot;&gt;{{myFirstCtrl.myAttr}}&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now everything related to the controller that you have bound is namespaced to it. This avoids the confusion of nested scopes and lets you easily distinguish where everything is coming from.</p>\n<h3>Can I Bind The Controller In The Route?</h3><p>Whenever possible, it is best to bind your controller in the route itself rather than inside your templates. That will look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function appConfig($routeProvider) {\n    $routeProvider\n        .when(&#39;/myRoute/:id&#39;, {\n            templateUrl: &#39;/templates/myTemplate.html&#39;,\n            controller: &#39;MyFirstController&#39;,\n            controllerAs: &#39;myFirstCtrl&#39;\n        });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This functionally works the same as setting the controller in the template. Everything in the <code>this</code> context of the controller is namespaced to <code>myFirstCtrl</code>.</p>\n<p>I can say from my own personal experience that I ditched the use of <code>$scope</code> a few weeks ago and I haven&#39;t missed it at all. I feel good knowing that I&#39;m working towards an easier migration once Angular 2.0 is ready and my applications have honestly been much easier to read and debug.</p>\n"},"testing-angular-controllers-with-karma":{"published":true,"title":"Testing Angular Controllers With Karma","tags":["angular","karma","unit testing"],"category":"code","date":"10/10/2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/testing-angular-controllers-with-karma.jpeg"},"new-job-at-aloompa":{"published":true,"title":"My New Job At Aloompa","tags":["jobs","life"],"category":"life","date":"9-24-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/aloompa.png"},"getting-started-with-react":{"published":true,"title":"Getting Started With React","tags":["react"],"category":"code","date":"9-08-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/react.png"},"automatically-refresh-your-browser-when-your-code-changes-with-bowsersync":{"published":true,"title":"Automatically Refresh Your Browser When Your Code Changes With BrowserSync","tags":["browsers","browsersync"],"category":"code","date":"9-03-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/browsersync.png"},"how-to-upload-remote-images-with-sails-js":{"published":true,"title":"How To Upload Remote Images With SailsJS","tags":["sailsjs","amazons3"],"category":"code","date":"8-18-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/how-to-upload-remote-images-with-sails-js.png"},"communicating-between-controllers-in-angular":{"published":true,"title":"Communicating Between Controllers In Angular","tags":["angular","pubsub"],"category":"code","date":"8-11-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/communicating-between-controllers-in-angular.jpg"},"the-state-of-javascript-a-shift-from-imperative-to-declarative":{"published":true,"title":"The State Of JavaScript - A Shift From Imperative To Declarative","tags":["javascript"],"category":"code","date":"8-04-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/the-state-of-javascript-a-shift-from-imperative-to-declarative.jpg"},"using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement-on-lists":{"published":true,"title":"Progressive Enhancement With the Knockout Foreach Binding","tags":["knockout","progressive-enhancement"],"category":"code","date":"7-28-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement-on-lists.jpg"},"using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement":{"published":true,"title":"Using Knockout For Progressive Enhancement","tags":["knockout","progressive-enhancement"],"category":"code","date":"7-14-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement.jpg"},"how_to_not_be_a_cyborg_when_you_work_on_computers":{"published":true,"title":"How To Not Be A Cyborg When You Work On Computers","tags":["productivity","working-from-home","work-life-balance"],"category":"productivity","date":"7-03-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/cyborg.png"},"syncing-angular-with-sails":{"published":true,"series":"Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js","part":7,"lastPart":true,"title":"Syncing Angular With Sails","tags":["sailsjs","angular"],"category":"code","date":"6-30-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/syncing-angular-with-sails.png"},"sails-models":{"published":true,"series":"Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js","part":6,"title":"Sails Models","tags":["sailsjs"],"category":"code","date":"6-27-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/sails-models.png"},"angular-controllers-with-sails-app":{"published":true,"series":"Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js","part":5,"title":"Angular Controllers","tags":["angular"],"category":"code","date":"6-12-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/angular-controllers-with-sails-app.png","yield":"<div class=\"series-placement\">\n\n    This is part 5 of the <a href=\"/blog/sails-ninja-intro\">Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js</a> blog series.

Now that everything is in place, we can jump right in to adding Angular views.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h3>Create the List Route</h3><p>First, we will generate a new controller and model called &quot;list&quot;:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">sails generate list\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we will add a link to the list page in our layout.ejs file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;li class=&quot;&lt;% if (title === &#39;List&#39;) { %&gt;active&lt;% } %&gt;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;%- link_to(&#39;List&#39;, &#39;/list&#39;) %&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, if we open our <code>/api/controllers/ListController.js</code> file, we can add a method to render the index page:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">module.exports = {\n  index: function (req, res) {\n    res.view(null, {\n        title: &#39;List&#39;\n    });\n  },\n  _config: {}\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, we will create a view for the lists in <code>/views/list/index.ejs</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ul class=&quot;checklist&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked /&gt; Do a thing\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; /&gt; Do another thing\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; /&gt; Do a third thing\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-danger&quot;&gt;Remove&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Add the Angular Controller</h3><p>Now that we&#39;ve got the view rendering for our list, we can add an Angular controller to it.</p>\n<p>We will update the markup for the <code>views/list/index.ejs</code> template to use Angular:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div ng-controller=&quot;ListCtrl&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;ul class=&quot;checklist&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;li ng-repeat=&quot;item in items&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; ng-checked=&quot;item.completed&quot; /&gt; &lt;span ng-bind=&quot;item.description&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; ng-click=&quot;addItem&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-danger&quot; ng-click=&quot;removeItems&quot;&gt;Remove&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Angular bindings to take note of are the <code>ng-controller</code>. That will bind everything inside of it to the context of the controller we specified. Next, there is the <code>ng-repeat</code>, which loops over items in the scope.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve added the controller to the markup, we need to actually create the controller in JavaScript. Let&#39;s look at our <code>/assets/js/app.js</code> file. We&#39;ll need it to update it to look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define([\n  &#39;angular&#39;,\n  &#39;sails.io&#39;,\n  &#39;controllers&#39;\n], function (angular, io) {\n\n  var socket = io.connect(), app;\n\n  socket.on(&#39;connect&#39;, function socketConnected() {\n    console.log(&#39;Socket is now connected&#39;);\n  });\n\n  app = angular.module(&#39;todoIt&#39;, [\n    &#39;controllers&#39;\n  ]);\n\n  return app;\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Basically, we are requiring a JavaScript file which we haven&#39;t created yet called <code>controllers.js</code>. We are also adding a &quot;controllers&quot; module to our application.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve got that in place, let&#39;s create the <code>/assets/js/controllers.js</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define(function (require) {\n\n  var angular = require(&#39;angular&#39;),\n      Controllers = angular.module(&#39;controllers&#39;, []);\n\n  Controllers.controller(&#39;ListCtrl&#39;, require(&#39;controllers/listCtrl&#39;));\n\n  return Controllers;\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>The great thing about the way we&#39;ve set up this file is that anytime we need to add a new controller, it&#39;s as simple as adding one new line. This will require the controller and initialize it.</p>\n<p>Now, we&#39;ll need to create a new directory at <code>/assets/js/controllers</code>. Inside our new folder, we&#39;ll make a file named <code>listCtrl.js</code>. The listCtrl.js file should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define(function () {\n    return [&#39;$scope&#39;, function($scope) {\n        $scope.addItem = function () {\n            console.log(&#39;addItem&#39;);\n        };\n        $scope.removeItems = function () {\n            console.log(&#39;removeItems&#39;);\n        };\n        $scope.items = [{\n            description: &#39;Do a thing&#39;,\n            completed: true\n        }, {\n            description: &#39;Do another thing&#39;,\n            completed: false\n        }, {\n            description: &#39;Do a third thing&#39;,\n            completed: false\n        }];\n    }];\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>So there we go. Each of our controller AMD modules will just return an array with the dependencies as the items in the array and a function as the last item, just like a regular Angular controller except the controller is being initialized in the controller.js file, not on an individual module basis.</p>\n<p>We are adding an array of &quot;items&quot; to the <code>$scope</code>. We also went ahead and stubbed out a couple of methods for the buttons. They&#39;ll just do a console.log for now, but we&#39;ll get them working soon.</p>\n<p>Now we have Angular controllers on top of our Sails app. At this point, the app should look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/angular-controllers-with-sails-app2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Next time we&#39;ll start getting real data on the app.</p>\n<p>If you want to see the point our sample app should be at by now, check out the Github repo <a href=\"https://github.com/tysoncadenhead/sails-angular-example-app/tree/12d1e1860f0c1ae5acead7f6011059ce6b637375\">at this point</a>.</p>\n"},"adding-dependencies":{"published":true,"series":"Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js","part":4,"title":"Adding Dependencies","tags":["sailsjs","angular"],"category":"code","date":"5-30-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/adding-the-dependencies.png","yield":"<div class=\"series-placement\">\n\n    This is part 4 of the <a href=\"/blog/sails-ninja-intro\">Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js</a> blog series. If you haven&#39;t read the introduction yet, you may want to start there.\n\n    <h4><a href=\"/blog/server-side-views\">Previous Post In This Series</a> | <a href=\"/blog/angular-controllers-with-sails-app\">Next Post In This Series</a></h4>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>As I promised at the beginning of this series, we are going to be using <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/\">RequireJS</a> to manage our client-side modules. If you haven&#39;t used RequireJS or a similar AMD loader before, let me just say that you are really missing out. RequireJS lets you write your code in small modules that only expose the parts of the API that you want to show and as an added bonus, it uses JavaScript to load your JavaScript modules.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p><img src=\"http://bower.io/img/bower-logo.png\" width=\"250px\" /></p>\n<h4>We Can Use Bower, Right?</h4><p>Before we get started, I wanted to give a quick rant about why using bower in a Sails project hasn&#39;t worked very well for me. <a href=\"http://bower.io\">Bower</a> is a package manager for client-side JavaScript much like <a href=\"http://www.npmjs.com/\">NPM</a> is for server-side JavaScript. Typically, I would use bower to manage my dependencies for any project. The issue is that Sails doesn&#39;t run your assets right out of the folder you create them in. Instead, it packages them up with Grunt and runs them out of <code>.tmp/public</code>. That approach is really helpful if you have a compilation step such as converting SASS or LESS stylesheets to CSS or minifying your JavaScript. The issue is that it if you have a ton of files in your assets directory, as is often the case when you have installed bower packages, you will inevitably either get errors complaining about the number of files being processed or it will be painfully slow. Either way, I&#39;ve come to the painful conclusion that using Bower with Sails is more trouble than it is worth.</p>\n<p>My compromise is typically to load my vendor files from a CDN whenever there is one instead of junking up my project with code that I didn&#39;t write.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ianreah.com/img/requirejs-logo.png\" alt=\"RequireJS\"></p>\n<h4>RequireJS</h4><p>There is actually some debate about whether or not RequireJS has value in an Angular project. Angular has a dependency injection concept that makes running the code itself pretty modular. However, it doesn&#39;t load specific files for you out of the box. There are a few ways to leverage the Angular library to load your files for you. To me, though, it seems simpler to follow a set standard like what RequireJS provides by closely following the AMD spec. That way, developers in the future will have a clearer idea of where the code is coming from and how it is being loaded.</p>\n<p>So, let&#39;s get RequireJS working.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s open the layout.ejs file and add a line to instantiate our Angular application. We will replace the body tag with this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;body ng-app=&quot;todoIt&quot;&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The name of the app can be whatever you want to call your application, but just be aware that you will be referencing it later in your javaScript.</p>\n<p>Next, we need to go to the bottom of the layout.ejs file and replace all of the JavaScript files with this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;script src=&quot;//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.1.11/require.min.js&quot; data-main=&quot;/js/main&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>That will load the require.min.js file from a CDN and then immediately require your <code>/js/main.js</code> file. Don&#39;t have a main.js file yet? No problem. Let&#39;s go ahead and build that.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">window.name = &#39;NG_DEFER_BOOTSTRAP!&#39;;\n\nrequire.config({\n  &#39;baseUrl&#39;: &#39;/js&#39;,\n  &#39;paths&#39;: {\n    &#39;angular&#39;: &#39;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.16/angular&#39;,\n    &#39;jquery&#39;: &#39;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min&#39;,\n    &#39;bootstrap&#39;: &#39;//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/js/bootstrap.min&#39;\n  },\n  &#39;shim&#39;: {\n    &#39;angular&#39;: {\n      &#39;exports&#39;: &#39;angular&#39;\n    },\n    &#39;bootstrap&#39;: {\n      &#39;deps&#39;: [&#39;jquery&#39;]\n    },\n    &#39;socket.io&#39;: {\n      &#39;exports&#39;: &#39;io&#39;\n    },\n    &#39;sails.io&#39;: {\n      &#39;deps&#39;: [&#39;socket.io&#39;],\n      &#39;exports&#39;: &#39;io&#39;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nrequire([\n  &#39;angular&#39;,\n  &#39;app&#39;,\n  &#39;bootstrap&#39;\n], function (angular, app) {\n\n  angular.element(document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;html&#39;)[0]);\n\n  angular.element().ready(function() {\n    angular.resumeBootstrap([app.name]);\n  });\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice at the top where we set the <code>window.name</code> to &quot;NG_DEFER_BOOTSTRAP!&quot;. That will keep angular from initializing until we tell it to. Near the bottom after everything is loaded, we call angular.resumeBootstrap(). That is where angular picks back up and finishes initializing.</p>\n<p>The socket.io and sails.io files that come with Sails are not wrapped as AMD modules, so we need to shim them both and export the io variable.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the main.js is pretty standard for a requireJS config file. </p>\n<p>We will also need to update the app.js file to this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define([\n  &#39;angular&#39;,\n  &#39;sails.io&#39;\n], function (angular, io) {\n\n  var socket = io.connect(), app;\n\n  socket.on(&#39;connect&#39;, function socketConnected() {\n    console.log(&#39;Socket is now connected&#39;);\n  });\n\n  app = angular.module(&#39;todoIt&#39;, []);\n\n  return app;\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>We are leaving the socket.io connection. We&#39;ll be working with that later on. For now, we mostly just want to return our app as a new angular module. Notice that the name &quot;todoIt&quot; is the same as the <code>ng-app</code> that we added to our layout.ejs file.</p>\n<p>Now the main.js file will take the app that is returned from app.js and create an angular application.</p>\n<p>When you look at your console at this point, you should get a message that says:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">Socket is now connected\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you see that and don&#39;t get any errors, you have successfully added an angular application on top of Sails. Stay tuned next time when we make the application actually do something.</p>\n<p>If you want to see the code in action, check out the example repository <a

    <h1>A Crash Course On Angular Promises</h1>

    

    <h5><span class="label label-info"><a href="/?category=code">code</a></span> | 12/22/2014</h5>

    <p>Writing complex behaviors in an asynchronous language like JavaScript can be a bit of a challenge. If you aren&#39;t careful, you can make some pretty ugly nested code in order to get things to work like you expect. To solve the problem of illegible nested callbacks, we have promises. If you are writing applications in Angular, you are in luck because Angular ships with a great promise library called &quot;Q&quot;. Today, we&#39;re going to look at a few approaches to making more readable and maintainable Angular applications with the help of the built in Q promise library.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/54391964.jpg" width="50%" alt=""></p>
<h3>What Are Promises?</h3><p>In the distant past, I have been guilty of writing things like this:</p>
<pre><code>myModels.getPerson({ id: 1 }, function (person) {
   myModels.getDad(person, function (dad) {
        myModels.getPet(dad, function (pet) {
            myModels.getPetColor(pet, function (color) {
                // ...
            });
        });
   });
});
</code></pre><p>It looks really ugly, but there were instances where I needed to make one asynchronous operation, then based on the data that I got back from the operation, I would need to make another operation and the tunnel of madness would begin. Promises are an answer to that problem.</p>
<p>Whether you know it or not, you&#39;ve probably been exposed to promises inside of libraries like jQuery when you tack a <code>then()</code> method on after a function.</p>
<p>The way it works is that the function returns a &quot;promise&quot; instead of a result. Inside the function, the promise can be resolved at some point and the <code>then()</code> method is fired which continues the chain of methods you are building.</p>
<p>Taking our contrived example above, if we were using promises, it might look more like this:</p>
<pre><code>myModels
    .getPerson({
        id: 1
    })
    .then(myModels.getDad)
    .then(myModels.getPet)
    .then(myModels.getPetColor)
    .done(function (data) {
        // ...
    });
</code></pre><p>Now we&#39;ve got an API that is readable and maintainable. Life is good again.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/01/015f8f78101fcf7e97a3b9492a1aee81f7ed3958b5356eee14cf8391a98d2888.jpg" width="50%" /></p>
<h3>What Is <code>Q</code>?</h3><p>There are numerous promise libraries out there, but Angular ships with one called <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">Q</a>. It is a really nice library and I&#39;ve used it for some of my non-Angular and even some of my Node projects in the past. Angular can inject <code>$q</code> directly, but some of the services, such as the <code>$resource</code> service already use it under the hood.</p>
<p><img src="http://ct.fra.bz/ol/fz/sw/i59/5/9/27/frabz-One-does-Not-Simply-give-a-promise-then-pretend-it-never-happen-2d0ebe.jpg" width="50%" /></p>
<h3>Deferring A Promise</h3><p>The syntax for deferring a promise is pretty straightforward. You need to instantiate a new <code>$q.defer()</code> and then return the promise off of the object that it returns. When you&#39;re done doing what you&#39;re doing, you just need to resolve the deferred object. If you have any data that you want to pass into the resolve function, you can pass it as the first argument.</p>
<pre><code>angular
    .module(&#39;myApp&#39;)
    .service(&#39;Wait&#39;, Wait);

Wait.$inject = [&#39;$q&#39;, &#39;$window&#39;];

function Wait ($q, $window) {

    var service = {};

    service.waitFor = waitFor;

    function waitFor (ms) {
        var deferred = $q.defer();

        $window.setTimeout(function () {
            deferred.resolve();
        }, ms);

        return deferred.promise;
    }

    return service;

}
</code></pre><p>The service above could be used like this:</p>
<pre><code>angular
    .module(&#39;myApp&#39;)
    .controller(&#39;MyController&#39;, MyController);

MyController.$inject = [&#39;Wait&#39;];

function MyController (Wait) {
    Wait
        .waitFor(1000)
        .then(function () {
            alerted(&#39;I already waited for a second! I\&#39;m bored!&#39;);
        });
}
</code></pre><p><img src="http://djebbz.github.io/async-paris-js/images/why-so-asynchronous.jpg" width="50%" /></p>
<h3>Waiting For Multiple Promises</h3><p>Sometimes, you have multiple promise you want to resolve, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily matter what order the functions are executed in. You just want to execute multiple asynchronous operations and get notified when they are done. For that, we have <code>$q.all</code>. The &quot;all&quot; method takes an array of functions and gives you a callback when they are all completed.</p>
<p>Using <code>$q.all</code> looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>angular
    .module(&#39;myApp&#39;)
    .controller(&#39;MyController&#39;, MyController);

MyController.$inject = [&#39;$q&#39;, &#39;$window&#39;];

function MyController ($q, $window) {

    $q.all([
        $q(firstThing()),
        $q(firstSecond()),
        $q(thirdThing())
    ])
    .then(function (data) {
        // ...
    });

    function firstThing () {
        var deferred = $q.defer();

        $window
            .setTimeout(deferred.resolve, 1000);

        return deferred.promise;
    }

    function secondThing () {
        var deferred = $q.defer();

        $window
            .setTimeout(deferred.resolve, 2000);

        return deferred.promise;
    }

    function thirdThing () {
        var deferred = $q.defer();

        $window
            .setTimeout(deferred.resolve, 3000);

        return deferred.promise;
    }

}
</code></pre><p>Note that the each function you are passing into the array that is the first argument of <code>$q.all</code> method needs to be wrapped in a <code>$q</code>. That might seem a little tedious, but it keeps the functions from executing without a proper callback and in turn breaking the chain.</p>
<p>There might be a little learning curve with Angular promises, but it is well worth the effort. Promises can go a long way to make cleaner more maintainable code and I&#39;ve found that the implementation in Angular is very solid.</p>
