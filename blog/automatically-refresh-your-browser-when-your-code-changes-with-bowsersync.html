I had to save my file and then flip over to my browser to check my results. As a result, I was clicking two buttons every time I wanted to save a file. To make matters worse, I had to repeat the process to test my application in multiple browsers. To test a minimum of Chrome, Firefox and a single version of Internet Explorer, I was clicking 4 buttons. To repeat that flow over and over again to test incremental changes was soul killing.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/auqaman.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>LiveReload</h3>\n<p>A few years ago, a solution called <a href=\"http://livereload.com/\">LiveReload</a> was introduced to address this problem. Using LiveReload, I could tell my computer to watch a certain directory for changes. When a change occurred in one of my files, it would refresh the browser. My workflow with LiveReload was much easier, but the setup was a pain. Anytime I&#39;d set up a new project, I found myself spending an inordinate amount of time setting up a grunt task to watch certain files and keep my browser up to date. Ultimately, I found myself slipping back into the old flow of development on smaller projects because it was too much of a pain to get working.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/superman.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>Enter BrowserSync</h3>\n<p>A few days ago, I tried out <a href=\"http://www.browsersync.io/\">BrowserSync</a> for the first time. BrowserSync is available as a Grunt or Gulp plugin, but it is also really simple to run as a process in the terminal.</p>\n<p>BrowserSync runs with NodeJS, so if you already have Node installed, you just need to install the <code>browser-sync</code> package like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install -g browser-sync</code></pre>\n<p>Once BrowserSync is installed, you can use it to watch static files or you can create a proxy for a dynamic site. For example, if I have a SailsJS application, I could watch the files in the <code>public</code> directory like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">browser-sync start --proxy &quot;localhost:3117&quot; --files &quot;public/**/*&quot;</code></pre>\n<p>BrowserSync will create a proxy to serve the site through and open a browser window pointing to that proxy. Now, anytime I change a file in my <code>public</code> directory, the browser window will be refreshed and I will see the latest code.</p>\n<p>BrowserSync doesn&#39;t care what backend technology you are using. I typically write in Node, but if I was using PHP or Ruby, it would work exactly the same.</p>\n<p>I have been really impressed with BrowserSync so far. Try it out, you may find yourself in a happier place.</p>\n"},"how-to-upload-remote-images-with-sails-js":{"published":true,"title":"How To Upload Remote Images With SailsJS","tags":["sailsjs","amazons3"],"category":"code","date":"8-18-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/how-to-upload-remote-images-with-sails-js.png"},"communicating-between-controllers-in-angular":{"published":true,"title":"Communicating Between Controllers In Angular","tags":["angular","pubsub"],"category":"code","date":"8-11-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/communicating-between-controllers-in-angular.jpg"},"the-state-of-javascript-a-shift-from-imperative-to-declarative":{"published":true,"title":"The State Of JavaScript - A Shift From Imperative To Declarative","tags":["javascript"],"category":"code","date":"8-04-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/the-state-of-javascript-a-shift-from-imperative-to-declarative.jpg"},"using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement-on-lists":{"published":true,"title":"Progressive Enhancement With the Knockout Foreach Binding","tags":["knockout","progressive-enhancement"],"category":"code","date":"7-28-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement-on-lists.jpg","slug":"using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement-on-lists"},"using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement":{"published":true,"title":"Using Knockout For Progressive Enhancement","tags":["knockout","progressive-enhancement"],"category":"code","date":"7-14-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement.jpg"},"how_to_not_be_a_cyborg_when_you_work_on_computers":{"published":true,"title":"How To Not Be A Cyborg When You Work On Computers","tags":["productivity","working-from-home","work-life-balance"],"category":"productivity","date":"7-03-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/cyborg.png"},"syncing-angular-with-sails":{"published":true,"series":"Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js","part":7,"lastPart":true,"title":"Syncing Angular With Sails","tags":["sailsjs","angular"],"category":"code","date":"6-30-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/syncing-angular-with-sails.png"},"sails-models":{"published":true,"series":"Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js","part":6,"title":"Sails Models","tags":["sailsjs"],"category":"code","date":"6-27-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/sails-models.png"},"angular-controllers-with-sails-app":{"published":true,"series":"Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js","part":5,"title":"Angular Controllers","tags":["angular"],"category":"code","date":"6-12-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/angular-controllers-with-sails-app.png","yield":"<div class=\"series-placement\">\n\n    This is part 5 of the <a href=\"/blog/sails-ninja-intro\">Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js</a> blog series. If you haven&#39;t read the introduction yet, you may want to start there.\n\n    <h4><a href=\"/blog/adding-dependencies\">Previous Post In This Series</a> | <a href=\"/blog/sails-models\">Next Post In This Series</a></h4>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>In the past few posts, I&#39;ve been laying the groundwork for building an Angular application on top of Sails. Now that everything is in place, we can jump right in to adding Angular views.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h3>Create the List Route</h3>\n<p>First, we will generate a new controller and model called &quot;list&quot;:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">sails generate list</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we will add a link to the list page in our layout.ejs file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;li class=&quot;&lt;% if (title === &#39;List&#39;) { %&gt;active&lt;% } %&gt;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;%- link_to(&#39;List&#39;, &#39;/list&#39;) %&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Now, if we open our <code>/api/controllers/ListController.js</code> file, we can add a method to render the index page:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">module.exports = {\n  index: function (req, res) {\n    res.view(null, {\n        title: &#39;List&#39;\n    });\n  },\n  _config: {}\n};</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, we will create a view for the lists in <code>/views/list/index.ejs</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ul class=&quot;checklist&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked /&gt; Do a thing\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; /&gt; Do another thing\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; /&gt; Do a third thing\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-danger&quot;&gt;Remove&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>Add the Angular Controller</h3>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve got the view rendering for our list, we can add an Angular controller to it.</p>\n<p>We will update the markup for the <code>views/list/index.ejs</code> template to use Angular:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div ng-controller=&quot;ListCtrl&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;ul class=&quot;checklist&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;li ng-repeat=&quot;item in items&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; ng-checked=&quot;item.completed&quot; /&gt; &lt;span ng-bind=&quot;item.description&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; ng-click=&quot;addItem&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-danger&quot; ng-click=&quot;removeItems&quot;&gt;Remove&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The Angular bindings to take note of are the <code>ng-controller</code>. That will bind everything inside of it to the context of the controller we specified. Next, there is the <code>ng-repeat</code>, which loops over items in the scope.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve added the controller to the markup, we need to actually create the controller in JavaScript. Let&#39;s look at our <code>/assets/js/app.js</code> file. We&#39;ll need it to update it to look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define([\n  &#39;angular&#39;,\n  &#39;sails.io&#39;,\n  &#39;controllers&#39;\n], function (angular, io) {\n\n  var socket = io.connect(), app;\n\n  socket.on(&#39;connect&#39;, function socketConnected() {\n    console.log(&#39;Socket is now connected&#39;);\n  });\n\n  app = angular.module(&#39;todoIt&#39;, [\n    &#39;controllers&#39;\n  ]);\n\n  return app;\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Basically, we are requiring a JavaScript file which we haven&#39;t created yet called <code>controllers.js</code>. We are also adding a &quot;controllers&quot; module to our application.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve got that in place, let&#39;s create the <code>/assets/js/controllers.js</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define(function (require) {\n\n  var angular = require(&#39;angular&#39;),\n      Controllers = angular.module(&#39;controllers&#39;, []);\n\n  Controllers.controller(&#39;ListCtrl&#39;, require(&#39;controllers/listCtrl&#39;));\n\n  return Controllers;\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>The great thing about the way we&#39;ve set up this file is that anytime we need to add a new controller, it&#39;s as simple as adding one new line. This will require the controller and initialize it.</p>\n<p>Now, we&#39;ll need to create a new directory at <code>/assets/js/controllers</code>. Inside our new folder, we&#39;ll make a file named <code>listCtrl.js</code>. The listCtrl.js file should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define(function () {\n    return [&#39;$scope&#39;, function($scope) {\n        $scope.addItem = function () {\n            console.log(&#39;addItem&#39;);\n        };\n        $scope.removeItems = function () {\n            console.log(&#39;removeItems&#39;);\n        };\n        $scope.items = [{\n            description: &#39;Do a thing&#39;,\n            completed: true\n        }, {\n            description: &#39;Do another thing&#39;,\n            completed: false\n        }, {\n            description: &#39;Do a third thing&#39;,\n            completed: false\n        }];\n    }];\n});</code></pre>\n<p>So there we go. Each of our controller AMD modules will just return an array with the dependencies as the items in the array and a function as the last item, just like a regular Angular controller except the controller is being initialized in the controller.js file, not on an individual module basis.</p>\n<p>We are adding an array of &quot;items&quot; to the <code>$scope</code>. We also went ahead and stubbed out a couple of methods for the buttons. They&#39;ll just do a console.log for now, but we&#39;ll get them working soon.</p>\n<p>Now we have Angular controllers on top of our Sails app. At this point, the app should look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/angular-controllers-with-sails-app2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Next time we&#39;ll start getting real data on the app.</p>\n<p>If you want to see the point our sample app should be at by now, check out the Github repo <a href=\"https://github.com/tysoncadenhead/sails-angular-example-app/tree/12d1e1860f0c1ae5acead7f6011059ce6b637375\">at this point</a>.</p>\n"},"adding-dependencies":{"published":true,"series":"Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js","part":4,"title":"Adding Dependencies","tags":["sailsjs","angular"],"category":"code","date":"5-30-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/adding-the-dependencies.png","yield":"<div class=\"series-placement\">\n\n    This is part 4 of the <a href=\"/blog/sails-ninja-intro\">Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js</a> blog series. If you haven&#39;t read the introduction yet, you may want to start there.\n\n    <h4><a href=\"/blog/server-side-views\">Previous Post In This Series</a> | <a href=\"/blog/angular-controllers-with-sails-app\">Next Post In This Series</a></h4>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>As I promised at the beginning of this series, we are going to be using <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/\">RequireJS</a> to manage our client-side modules. If you haven&#39;t used RequireJS or a similar AMD loader before, let me just say that you are really missing out. RequireJS lets you write your code in small modules that only expose the parts of the API that you want to show and as an added bonus, it uses JavaScript to load your JavaScript modules.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bower.io/img/bower-logo.png\" width=\"250px\" /></p>\n<h4>We Can Use Bower, Right?</h4>\n<p>Before we get started, I wanted to give a quick rant about why using bower in a Sails project hasn&#39;t worked very well for me. <a href=\"http://bower.io\">Bower</a> is a package manager for client-side JavaScript much like <a href=\"http://www.npmjs.com/\">NPM</a> is for server-side JavaScript. Typically, I would use bower to manage my dependencies for any project. The issue is that Sails doesn&#39;t run your assets right out of the folder you create them in. Instead, it packages them up with Grunt and runs them out of <code>.tmp/public</code>. That approach is really helpful if you have a compilation step such as converting SASS or LESS stylesheets to CSS or minifying your JavaScript. The issue is that it if you have a ton of files in your assets directory, as is often the case when you have installed bower packages, you will inevitably either get errors complaining about the number of files being processed or it will be painfully slow. Either way, I&#39;ve come to the painful conclusion that using Bower with Sails is more trouble than it is worth.</p>\n<p>My compromise is typically to load my vendor files from a CDN whenever there is one instead of junking up my project with code that I didn&#39;t write.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ianreah.com/img/requirejs-logo.png\" alt=\"RequireJS\"></p>\n<h4>RequireJS</h4>\n<p>There is actually some debate about whether or not RequireJS has value in an Angular project. Angular has a dependency injection concept that makes running the code itself pretty modular. However, it doesn&#39;t load specific files for you out of the box. There are a few ways to leverage the Angular library to load your files for you. To me, though, it seems simpler to follow a set standard like what RequireJS provides by closely following the AMD spec. That way, developers in the future will have a clearer idea of where the code is coming from and how it is being loaded.</p>\n<p>So, let&#39;s get RequireJS working.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s open the layout.ejs file and add a line to instantiate our Angular application. We will replace the body tag with this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;body ng-app=&quot;todoIt&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The name of the app can be whatever you want to call your application, but just be aware that you will be referencing it later in your javaScript.</p>\n<p>Next, we need to go to the bottom of the layout.ejs file and replace all of the JavaScript files with this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;script src=&quot;//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.1.11/require.min.js&quot; data-main=&quot;/js/main&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>That will load the require.min.js file from a CDN and then immediately require your <code>/js/main.js</code> file. Don&#39;t have a main.js file yet? No problem. Let&#39;s go ahead and build that.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">window.name = &#39;NG_DEFER_BOOTSTRAP!&#39;;\n\nrequire.config({\n  &#39;baseUrl&#39;: &#39;/js&#39;,\n  &#39;paths&#39;: {\n    &#39;angular&#39;: &#39;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.16/angular&#39;,\n    &#39;jquery&#39;: &#39;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min&#39;,\n    &#39;bootstrap&#39;: &#39;//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/js/bootstrap.min&#39;\n  },\n  &#39;shim&#39;: {\n    &#39;angular&#39;: {\n      &#39;exports&#39;: &#39;angular&#39;\n    },\n    &#39;bootstrap&#39;: {\n      &#39;deps&#39;: [&#39;jquery&#39;]\n    },\n    &#39;socket.io&#39;: {\n      &#39;exports&#39;: &#39;io&#39;\n    },\n    &#39;sails.io&#39;: {\n      &#39;deps&#39;: [&#39;socket.io&#39;],\n      &#39;exports&#39;: &#39;io&#39;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nrequire([\n  &#39;angular&#39;,\n  &#39;app&#39;,\n  &#39;bootstrap&#39;\n], function (angular, app) {\n\n  angular.element(document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;html&#39;)[0]);\n\n  angular.element().ready(function() {\n    angular.resumeBootstrap([app.name]);\n  });\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Notice at the top where we set the <code>window.name</code> to &quot;NG_DEFER_BOOTSTRAP!&quot;. That will keep angular from initializing until we tell it to. Near the bottom after everything is loaded, we call angular.resumeBootstrap(). That is where angular picks back up and finishes initializing.</p>\n<p>The socket.io and sails.io files that come with Sails are not wrapped as AMD modules, so we need to shim them both and export the io variable.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the main.js is pretty standard for a requireJS config file. </p>\n<p>We will also need to update the app.js file to this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define([\n  &#39;angular&#39;,\n  &#39;sails.io&#39;\n], function (angular, io) {\n\n  var socket = io.connect(), app;\n\n  socket.on(&#39;connect&#39;, function socketConnected() {\n    console.log(&#39;Socket is now connected&#39;);\n  });\n\n  app = angular.module(&#39;todoIt&#39;, []);\n\n  return app;\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>We are leaving the socket.io connection. We&#39;ll be working with that later on. For now, we mostly just want to return our app as a new angular module. Notice that the name &quot;todoIt&quot; is the same as the <code>ng-app</code> that we added to our layout.ejs file.</p>\n<p>Now the main.js file will take the app that is returned from app.js and create an angular application.</p>\n<p>When you look at your console at this point, you should get a message that says:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">Socket is now connected</code></pre>\n<p>If you see that and don&#39;t get any errors, you have successfully added an angular application on top of Sails.

I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve had a great idea for an app, but instead of jumping in and writing the core functionality, I try to tackle the authentication layer first. The problem is that once I&#39;ve gotten authentication in place, my excitement for the project has faded because I wasn&#39;t working on the project itself, just trying to set up a login system. Meteor takes the work out of setting up authentication so that you can focus on more important things, like writing the core functionality for your app.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>Meteor has a really robust account and password API, but we won&#39;t cover all of it here. We are just going to focus on getting something in place really fast. The reason for that is because we don&#39;t want to spend a lot of time working on authentication on the front-end, we want to work on core functionality.</p>\n<p>To work with authentication in Meteor, you will need to install the base accounts module.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">meteor add accounts-base</code></pre>\n<p>Meteor also has a pre-built user interface for accounts. If you want to go back later and make the UI different, you can, but for us to take a &quot;failing forward&quot; approach to development, it makes sense to just use the default UI and then go back and refactor it as needed. Let&#39;s install the accounts user interface package.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">meteor add accounts-ui</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we will need to install one of the authentication systems. Meteor comes packed with authentication through Facebook, Google, Github, Meetup, Twitter, Weibo and with a username and password. There are also third-party authentication types that were not written by the Meteor team.</p>\n<p>We will start out with just the basic username and password.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">meteor add accounts-password</code></pre>\n<p>Now if you start up your site by running <code>meteor</code>, you&#39;ll notice that nothing has changed. It should still look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/meteorauth.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In order to see your login UI, you will need to add it to your template. That is as easy as adding <code>{{loginButtons}}</code> anywhere in your template. If you want the buttons to go on the right side of the screen, you can pass that in an argument like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html4strict\">{{loginButtons align=&quot;right&quot;}}</code></pre>\n<p>Either way, though, the login buttons should be rendered:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/meteorauth2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When you click on the new &quot;sign in&quot; button, you should get something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/meteorauth3.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You now have authentication on your app!</p>\n<p>The templates also have a <code>{{currentUser}}</code> that you can use to determine if the user has authenticated or not. For example, if you want to display a navigation only if the user is logged in, that might look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html4strict\">&lt;ul&gt;\n{{#if currentUser}}\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/account&quot;&gt;My Account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/preferences&quot;&gt;My Preferences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n{{/if}}\n&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>When a user is logged in, your client-side JavaScript has access to a <code>Meteor.userId()</code> which is just a string representing the ID of the authenticated user. You also have access to a <code>Meteor.user()</code>, which will return an object with the user information. Depending on what authentication type you use, the content of the user object my vary. Both of those are available from the console, so you can log them at any time.</p>\n<p>Each user object also has a profile that you can add your own data to. For example, if you wanted to add some data to the current user, you could do something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">Meteor.users.update(Meteor.userId(), {\n    $set: {\n        profile: {\n            firstName: &#39;Linus&#39;,\n            lastName: &#39;Cadenhead&#39;,\n            favoriteColor: &#39;green&#39;,\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}, function () {\n    alert(&#39;user was saved&#39;);\n});</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to listen for an event to tell you when a user logs in or out, <code>Meteor.autorun</code> is your friend. This snippet will redirect the user when they log in or out:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Keep the current user logged in state\nvar loggedIn = !!Meteor.userId();\n\n// This is fired whenever the user logs in or out\nMeteor.autorun(function () {\n\n    // If the user logs in, redirect them to the profile\n    if (Meteor.userId() &amp;&amp; !loggedIn) {\n        document.location = &#39;/profile&#39;;\n\n    // If the user logs out, redirect them to the home page\n    } else if (!Meteor.userId() &amp;&amp; loggedIn) {\n        document.location = &#39;/&#39;;\n    }\n\n    // Set the current loggedIn status based on whether the userId is available or not\n    loggedIn = !!Meteor.userId();\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to add another authentication method, just install it with Meteor. The user interface itself will walk you through the necessary steps to get things set up.</p>\n<p>As you can see, authentication with Meteor is really quick and easy. In just a few minutes, you should be all set up and ready to work on the parts of your application that you care about. Yet another way that Meteor makes wasting time on tedious tasks a thing of the past!</p>\n"},"why-you-should-teach-your-kids-to-write-code":{"published":true,"title":"Why You Should Teach Your Kids

href=\"https://npmjs.org/package/compound-passport\">Compound-Passport</a>. If you aren&#39;t familiar with <a href=\"http://passportjs.org/\">Passport</a>, it is an authentication library for Node that provides a common API to authenticate with Facebook, Twitter, Google, Github and over a hundred other OpenId and OAuth login sources.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>This is how I was able to get authentication with Facebook added to an application within minutes.</p>\n<p>First of all, you&#39;ll need to have a CompoundJS app. If you need help with that, check out my previous blog post on <a href=\"/blog/how-do-yo-make-a-compoundjs-app/\">how to make a CompoundJS application</a>.</p>\n<p>My first step was to install the compound-passport package with npm.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">#install compound-passport\nnpm install compound-passport\n\n#install passport\nnpm install passport\n\n#install passports facebook authentication piece\nnpm install passport-facebook</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, we&#39;re installing the Facebook connection module.

This will need to be saved in config/passport.yml</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yml\">development:\n  baseURL: &#39;http://localhost:3000/&#39;\n  facebook:\n    apiKey: &quot;my-api-key&quot;\n    secret: &quot;my-secret&quot;</code></pre>\n<p>You will need to use your Facebook API Key and secret. You can acquire both of them from the [<a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/apps](Facebook\">https://developers.facebook.com/apps](Facebook</a> Developers site).</p>\n<p>Next, we&#39;ll need to modify our config/autoload.js file. I&#39;m showing the entire file, but the only real takeaway here is that the array that is returned from the module.exports() function needs to contain require(&#39;compound-passport&#39;).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">module.exports = function (compound) {\n  var defaultModules = [\n      &#39;jugglingdb&#39;,\n      &#39;co-assets-compiler&#39;\n    ], developmentModules = [];\n\n  if (&#39;development&#39; === compound.app.get(&#39;env&#39;)) {\n    developmentModules = [\n      &#39;ejs-ext&#39;,\n      &#39;seedjs&#39;,\n      &#39;co-generators&#39;,\n      &#39;compound-passport&#39;\n    ]\n  }\n\n  if (typeof window === &#39;undefined&#39;) {\n    return defaultModules.concat(developmentModules).map(require);\n  } else {\n    return []\n  }\n\n};</code></pre>\n<p>In Compound, any before() filters that are added to the controllers/application_controller.js file are called before any standard controller methods. If we do something like this, we will have a req.user object available if the Facebook session have been authenticated. Otherwise, it will be null.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">before(function requireManager() {\n    User.find(session.passport.user, function (err, user) {\n        console.log(user);\n        if (user) {\n            req.user = user;\n        } else {\n            redirect(&#39;/login&#39;);\n        }\n        next();\n    });\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Last of all, if we create a login page like this, everything should come together.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html4strict\">&lt;a href=&quot;/auth/facebook&quot;&gt;Login with Facebook&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Has anyone else been working with Compound-Passport?

    <h1>Automatically Refresh Your Browser When Your Code Changes With BrowserSync</h1>

    

    <h5><span class="label label-info"><a href="/?category=code">code</a></span> | 9-03-2014</h5>

    <p>When I first started writing client-side applications, the process was terrible. I had to save my file and then flip over to my browser to check my results. As a result, I was clicking two buttons every time I wanted to save a file. To make matters worse, I had to repeat the process to test my application in multiple browsers. To test a minimum of Chrome, Firefox and a single version of Internet Explorer, I was clicking 4 buttons. To repeat that flow over and over again to test incremental changes was soul killing.</p>

<h3>LiveReload</h3>
<p>A few years ago, a solution called <a href="http://livereload.com/">LiveReload</a> was introduced to address this problem. Using LiveReload, I could tell my computer to watch a certain directory for changes. When a change occurred in one of my files, it would refresh the browser. My workflow with LiveReload was much easier, but the setup was a pain. Anytime I&#39;d set up a new project, I found myself spending an inordinate amount of time setting up a grunt task to watch certain files and keep my browser up to date. Ultimately, I found myself slipping back into the old flow of development on smaller projects because it was too much of a pain to get working.</p>

<h3>Enter BrowserSync</h3>
<p>A few days ago, I tried out <a href="http://www.browsersync.io/">BrowserSync</a> for the first time. BrowserSync is available as a Grunt or Gulp plugin, but it is also really simple to run as a process in the terminal.</p>
<p>BrowserSync runs with NodeJS, so if you already have Node installed, you just need to install the <code>browser-sync</code> package like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install -g browser-sync</code></pre>
<p>Once BrowserSync is installed, you can use it to watch static files or you can create a proxy for a dynamic site. For example, if I have a SailsJS application, I could watch the files in the <code>public</code> directory like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">browser-sync start --proxy &quot;localhost:3117&quot; --files &quot;public/**/*&quot;</code></pre>
<p>BrowserSync will create a proxy to serve the site through and open a browser window pointing to that proxy. Now, anytime I change a file in my <code>public</code> directory, the browser window will be refreshed and I will see the latest code.</p>
<p>BrowserSync doesn&#39;t care what backend technology you are using. I typically write in Node, but if I was using PHP or Ruby, it would work exactly the same.</p>
<p>I have been really impressed with BrowserSync so far. Try it out, you may find yourself in a happier place.</p>
