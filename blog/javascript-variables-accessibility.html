I&#39;ll be giving a more formal announcement when I launch it, but the basic idea is that you can surf the internet and add recipes for any meals using a handy bookmarklet. Once the recipe is in the database, you can generate a meal plan with any recipes you have added. You can then print off a shopping list based on the contents of your weekly meal plan.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>While the concept is pretty simple, there have been a few gotchas. For example, I wanted to be able automatically to grab a photo of the recipe, download it to my server and resize it so that it would load quickly. The idea was pretty simple, but it took a little bit of research to find the right libraries to get the flow working.</p>\n<p>Sails ships with a file upload handler called <a href=\"https://github.com/balderdashy/skipper\">Skipper</a>, but that is for uploading files, not grabbing files off other websites and downloading them to our server.  I quickly realized, I was going to be working outside of the standard Sails workflow. Luckily, Sails is super-flexible and it can handle it.</p>\n<h3>Downloading Remote Images</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3064/2999268596_24ce077c58.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You could definitely download images from remote websites using the Node <code>http</code> module. However, I ran across the <a href=\"https://github.com/mikeal/request\">request</a> NPM module, which makes the task a ton easier. You can download request by running:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install request</code></pre>\n<p>Once that is done, you can move on to create an image service. In Sails applications, services are a way to share code that can be used in any controller. The service that we will create will go in <code>/api/services/images.js</code>.</p>\n<p>We can start out by providing a &quot;downloadFile&quot; method using request to grab the image and write it to the server.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var request = require(&#39;request&#39;);\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    downloadFile: function (uri, fileName, done) {\n        request.head(uri, function(err, res, body){\n            request(uri).pipe(fs.createWriteStream(fileName)).on(&#39;close&#39;, done);\n        });\n    }\n};</code></pre>\n<p>You can try access the &quot;downloadFile&quot; method from any controller. Try it out like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">image.downloadFile(\n    &#39;http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/srpr/logo11w.png&#39;,\n    &#39;./tmp/upload/googlelogo.png&#39;,\n    function (data) {\n        res.send(data);\n    });</code></pre>\n<h3>Resizing the Image</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.dagami.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/big-dog-little-dog.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Since a user could download an image from anywhere, there was a really real possibility that the images could be huge. I wanted make all of the images have the same (small) width so that the application would load faster. To do that, I found a library called &quot;GraphicsMagick.&quot; There is a little but of work required to get graphics magic running. You will need to use homebrew to install install it on your machine:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">brew install graphicsmagick</code></pre>\n<p>Personally, several of my permissions had to be updated in order to install GraphicsMagick. The error trail was easy to follow, but just be aware that it may not be as easy as you might hope. After the brew package is installed, you can install the NPM package:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install gm</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, you can add a resize method to your &quot;image&quot; service:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var gm = require(&#39;gm&#39;),\n    fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;),\n    request = require(&#39;request&#39;);\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\n    downloadFile: function (uri, fileName, done) {\n        request.head(uri, function(err, res, body){\n            request(uri).pipe(fs.createWriteStream(fileName)).on(&#39;close&#39;, done);\n        });\n    },\n\n    resize: function (srcPath, dstPath, width, done) {\n        gm(srcPath)\n            .options({imageMagick: true})\n            .resize(width)\n            .write(dstPath, done);\n    }\n\n};</code></pre>\n<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/179/394669949_34d59f1e86.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now that we have a downloadFile method and a resize method, we can create a third method that accesses both of them to download and resize the image that we pass in. We&#39;ll call this method <code>process</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var gm = require(&#39;gm&#39;),\n    fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;),\n    request = require(&#39;request&#39;);\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\n    downloadFile: function (uri, fileName, done) {\n        request.head(uri, function(err, res, body){\n            request(uri).pipe(fs.createWriteStream(fileName)).on(&#39;close&#39;, done);\n        });\n    },\n\n    resize: function (srcPath, dstPath, width, done) {\n        gm(srcPath)\n            .options({imageMagick: true})\n            .resize(width)\n            .write(dstPath, done);\n    },\n\n    process: function (uri, fileName, done) {\n        var self = this;\n        this.downloadFile(uri, fileName, function () {\n            self.resize(fileName, fileName, 200, done);\n        });\n    }\n\n};</code></pre>\n<p>Now, inside of any controller, we can call <code>image.process()</code> method. For example, we could download and resize the Google logo like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">image.process(\n    &#39;http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/srpr/logo11w.png&#39;,\n    &#39;./tmp/upload/googlelogo.png&#39;,\n    function (data) {\n        res.send(data);\n    });</code></pre>\n<p>Thanks to GraphicsMagick and the request module, downloading and resizing an image from any website using nothing more than a URL is actually not that difficult. Who would have thought?</p>\n"},"communicating-between-controllers-in-angular":{"published":true,"title":"Communicating Between Controllers In Angular","tags":["angular","pubsub"],"category":"code","date":"8-11-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/communicating-between-controllers-in-angular.jpg","slug":"communicating-between-controllers-in-angular","yield":"<p>In Angular, there are times when you will want one controller to be able to communicate with other controllers. For example, if you want your user to be able to click a button and for a different controller to be aware of the UI change.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>Take this markup as an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div ng-app=&quot;myApp&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div ng-controller=&quot;Ctrl1&quot;&gt;\n        The current number is: {{number}}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div ng-controller=&quot;Ctrl2&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;button ng-click=&quot;buttonClick()&quot;&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>It&#39;s a very basic contrived example, but we have a controller called &quot;Ctrl1&quot; that has a number in its scope. We also have a totally separate controller called &quot;Ctrl2&quot; that has a button with a click event on it.</p>\n<p>Our entire application might look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var myApp = angular.module(&#39;myApp&#39;, []);\n\nmyApp.controller(&#39;Ctrl1&#39;, [&#39;$scope&#39;, function ($scope) {\n    $scope.number = 1;\n}]);\n\nmyApp.controller(&#39;Ctrl2&#39;, [&#39;$scope&#39;, function ($scope) {\n    $scope.buttonClick = function () {\n        console.log(&#39;button was clicked&#39;);\n    };\n}]);</code></pre>\n<p>We obviously don&#39;t want to reference <code>Ctrl2</code> in <code>Ctrl1</code>. That is what we call &quot;tight coupling&quot; and it is a sure recipe for building an app that will  fall apart when changes are made. What we want to do is broadcast an event to let any controllers in the application know that there has been a change. That way, the controllers that are interested will react to the event, but no controller is directly communicating with any other controller. In other words, all <code>Ctrl1</code> knows is that it is broadcasting an event. All that <code>Ctrl2</code> knows is that it is listening for an event. They are completely unaware of the existence of one another.</p>\n<p>First of, we will need to modify <code>Ctrl1</code> to listen for an event. Angular gives us the ability to listen for and emit events on any module, but it won&#39;t do any good to listen for an event on the <code>$scope</code> of <code>Ctrl1</code> itself because <code>Ctrl2</code> can&#39;t send an event to it. It doesn&#39;t know that it exists. Instead, we will need to inject the $rootScope into our controller. The $rootScope is the application itself.</p>\n<p>Using the $rootScope and the <code>$on</code> method, we can listen for any events that are broadcast to the <code>$rootScope</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var myApp = angular.module(&#39;myApp&#39;, []);\n\nmyApp.controller(&#39;Ctrl1&#39;, [&#39;$scope&#39;, &#39;$rootScope&#39;, function ($scope, $rootScope) {\n    $scope.number = 1;\n    $rootScope.$on(&#39;buttonClicked&#39;, function () {\n        $scope.number++;\n    });\n}]);</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>$on</code> event that is triggered has two arguments, the context of the event and the data that is being broadcast. This means that you could actually pass an object of data with the event.</p>\n<p>Last of all, we will need to update <code>Ctrl2</code> to broadcast an event when the button is clicked. Again, this will need to happen on the <code>$rootScope</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">myApp.controller(&#39;Ctrl2&#39;, [&#39;$scope&#39;, &#39;$rootScope&#39;, function ($scope, $rootScope) {\n    $scope.buttonClick = function () {\n        $rootScope.$broadcast(&#39;buttonClicked&#39;);\n    };\n}]);</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, sending messages between controllers is actually pretty simple. If you&#39;d like to see this all together, I&#39;ve created a <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/63KWh/\">Fiddle</a> that you can try out. For more advanced messaging, I would recommend checking out Jonathan Creamer&#39;s article, &quot;<a href=\"http://jonathancreamer.com/an-angular-event-bus-with-postal-js/\">An angular.js event bus with postal.js</a>&quot; where he shows how do this same thing using Postal. His approach requires another library, but it does provide a more robust API to work with.</p>\n<p>How are you handling communication between modules and controllers in Angular? I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts.</p>\n"},"the-state-of-javascript-a-shift-from-imperative-to-declarative":{"published":true,"title":"The State Of JavaScript - A Shift From Imperative To Declarative","tags":["javascript"],"category":"code","date":"8-04-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/the-state-of-javascript-a-shift-from-imperative-to-declarative.jpg","slug":"the-state-of-javascript-a-shift-from-imperative-to-declarative"},"using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement-on-lists":{"published":true,"title":"Progressive Enhancement With the Knockout Foreach Binding","tags":["knockout","progressive-enhancement"],"category":"code","date":"7-28-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement-on-lists.jpg","slug":"using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement-on-lists"},"using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement":{"published":true,"title":"Using Knockout For Progressive Enhancement","tags":["knockout","progressive-enhancement"],"category":"code","date":"7-14-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/using-knockout-for-progressive-enhancement.jpg"},"how_to_not_be_a_cyborg_when_you_work_on_computers":{"published":true,"title":"How To Not Be A Cyborg When You Work On Computers","tags":["productivity","working-from-home","work-life-balance"],"category":"productivity","date":"7-03-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/cyborg.png","slug":"how_to_not_be_a_cyborg_when_you_work_on_computers","yield":"<p>When I was a kid, we had a family desktop computer that we kept in the living room. Since I had a brother and two sisters in addition to my parents, we had to ration our computer time to allow everyone to get on our amazing dailup connection and do whatever we liked to do. Because of that, we were limited to two hours of computer time a day.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>It was sometimes difficult to see my siblings doing things on the computer that I thought were a waste of time. Things like looking up statistics on sports teams or browsing the online American Girl catalog. I&#39;ll leave which of my siblings were doing each activity up to the imagination! When I was on the computer, it was my time to learn and to create. I was learning how to manipulate images, make 3D animations and write HTML. I was producing movies, graphic designs and static websites. They were all horrible and I would be ashamed of anything I made in high-school, but the point was that I was trying to maximize my scarce resource of time to produce something that would last. This came in the form of self-education and finished projects.</p>\n<p>In order to maximize my time, I would do as much as I could in preparation of my time on the computer. I would makes lists of the things I planned to accomplish when I finally got my turn. If I was working on an animation, I would storyboard it out by hand. If I was making a website, I would sketch it out on paper so I had a good idea of where my tables would span. I don&#39;t layout web pages in tables anymore, but it was the late 90s and tables were all we had at that point. I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, but one of the reasons I was so productive was that my time on the computer was a scarce resource that I couldn&#39;t afford to waste.</p>\n<p>Now, I have my own personal laptop. Taking care of adult responsibilities and children aside, I could literally be on it 24/7. Working in computer programming, it&#39;s actually an expectation of my job that I spend 8 hours each working day on the computer. However, I have found several hacks to keep me from being on the computer all the time.</p>\n<p>The great thing about limiting my time on devices is that it gives me more balance between work and the rest of my life. When I&#39;m not always on the computer, I have more time to prepare for when I do get on the computer by planning my workday, thinking more clearly, and clearing my mind so that I am fresh when I do get on.</p>\n<p>Being a human, I don&#39;t always perfectly follow these guidelines, but when I do, I&#39;ve found that they really help me to get the most out of my time. When I get the most out of my time, I can concentrate on the things that really matter, like my family.</p>\n<p>So, without further ado, here are my guidelines for not being a cyborg:</p>\n<h3>Plan Your Day Before You See a Screen</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.onlineuniversities.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/career-planning-sm.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Before I start my work for the day, I like to list out the things I want to accomplish. If there are more than 3 items on my list, I move the less urgent items to a list for the next day. Throughout the day, I can refer to my list to determine if I&#39;m getting the things done that I set out to do. The added benefit of getting to check items off the list is a reward unto itself.</p>\n<h3>Have Work Hours</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articles/slideshow/delusions-working-from-home/reduced-hours.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This one is a little harder for me because I work from home and our oldest son has autism and our youngest son is a baby, so I often need to help my wife during the day. However, this is one of the best ways to protect a balance between work and life outside of work. The trick here is to set a schedule for when you will be working and when you will not be working. This schedule should include breaks. It is unrealistic to think you can work at a computer for 8 or more hours straight without needing a break. </p>\n<p>If you have kids or animals inside, or if you have a chatty co-worker in the next cubicle, you have to be flexible. There will be some distractions. The key is to minimize distractions as much as possible. It is no secret that anytime you are torn out of a focused state of work, it can take as much as 15 minutes to get yourself back to the place you were at before the distraction.</p>\n<h3>Read Books, Not RSS Feeds</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/9/1326108641720/A-woman-reading-a-book-007.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This is something I have recently been trying to get better at. The temptation at the end of a day is to open my RSS reader on my smartphone and get the quick and easy satisfaction of reading several blog posts and articles rather than reading a book. The benefit of reading a book is that it is on paper, or at least on a Kindle that reads like paper. For someone who spends a lot of time looking at a monitor, it is important to save your eyes whenever you can.</p>\n<p>There is also the benefit of getting a better  education on a given topic. Most blog posts are concise by design and while they give you a quick look into a concept or idea, the length of a book is more ideal for fleshing it out.</p>\n<p>Articles and blog posts also limit you to the ideas of people from one time in history, namely today. This can be an advantage or a disadvantage. The advantage with blog posts comes when we are learning about things that are current and not timeless. For example, reading about a new technology makes more sense from a blog than a book, because tech is constantly evolving.</p>\n<h3>Give Up the Smartphone Nervous Tick</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.biologyoftechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/smartphones_people.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Have you ever forgotten to bring your phone when you went to pick up some fast food? It&#39;s crazy to look around at all of the people with their noses in their devices. It&#39;s almost awkward to not have a phone to look at. The sad thing is that you can miss out on the world around you if you are immersed in the digital world while you walk around from place to place.</p>\n<p>Try leaving your phone in the car when you meet your friends. At least you will be engaged in the conversation even if they aren&#39;t.</p>\n<h3>Write Things On Paper</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7061/6880096005_fe6a7eefac_z.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Writing on paper is becoming a thing of the past, but there are tools like <a href=\"http://evernote.com\">Evernote</a> that make it easy to get your scribbles into a digital format if you need to.</p>\n<p>I don&#39;t write blog posts on paper, but I tend to take notes in my sketchbook along with my sketches. It&#39;s interesting to me to see how the things that I&#39;m taking notes about and the sketches that I draw tend to line up. I am a visual thinker, so an illustration is often easier for me to understand than words.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m sure there are a ton of things you could do in addition to this to be able to live a full life and still work on a computer, but these were just some thoughts I had on the topic.</p>\n<p>Do you think it is important to create a separation between work and non-work activities?

Now that everything is in place, we can jump right in to adding Angular views.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h3>Create the List Route</h3>\n<p>First, we will generate a new controller and model called &quot;list&quot;:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">sails generate list</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we will add a link to the list page in our layout.ejs file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;li class=&quot;&lt;% if (title === &#39;List&#39;) { %&gt;active&lt;% } %&gt;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;%- link_to(&#39;List&#39;, &#39;/list&#39;) %&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Now, if we open our <code>/api/controllers/ListController.js</code> file, we can add a method to render the index page:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">module.exports = {\n  index: function (req, res) {\n    res.view(null, {\n        title: &#39;List&#39;\n    });\n  },\n  _config: {}\n};</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, we will create a view for the lists in <code>/views/list/index.ejs</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;ul class=&quot;checklist&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked /&gt; Do a thing\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; /&gt; Do another thing\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; /&gt; Do a third thing\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-danger&quot;&gt;Remove&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3>Add the Angular Controller</h3>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve got the view rendering for our list, we can add an Angular controller to it.</p>\n<p>We will update the markup for the <code>views/list/index.ejs</code> template to use Angular:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;div ng-controller=&quot;ListCtrl&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;ul class=&quot;checklist&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;li ng-repeat=&quot;item in items&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; ng-checked=&quot;item.completed&quot; /&gt; &lt;span ng-bind=&quot;item.description&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n\n    &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; ng-click=&quot;addItem&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-danger&quot; ng-click=&quot;removeItems&quot;&gt;Remove&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The Angular bindings to take note of are the <code>ng-controller</code>. That will bind everything inside of it to the context of the controller we specified. Next, there is the <code>ng-repeat</code>, which loops over items in the scope.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve added the controller to the markup, we need to actually create the controller in JavaScript. Let&#39;s look at our <code>/assets/js/app.js</code> file. We&#39;ll need it to update it to look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define([\n  &#39;angular&#39;,\n  &#39;sails.io&#39;,\n  &#39;controllers&#39;\n], function (angular, io) {\n\n  var socket = io.connect(), app;\n\n  socket.on(&#39;connect&#39;, function socketConnected() {\n    console.log(&#39;Socket is now connected&#39;);\n  });\n\n  app = angular.module(&#39;todoIt&#39;, [\n    &#39;controllers&#39;\n  ]);\n\n  return app;\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Basically, we are requiring a JavaScript file which we haven&#39;t created yet called <code>controllers.js</code>. We are also adding a &quot;controllers&quot; module to our application.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve got that in place, let&#39;s create the <code>/assets/js/controllers.js</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define(function (require) {\n\n  var angular = require(&#39;angular&#39;),\n      Controllers = angular.module(&#39;controllers&#39;, []);\n\n  Controllers.controller(&#39;ListCtrl&#39;, require(&#39;controllers/listCtrl&#39;));\n\n  return Controllers;\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>The great thing about the way we&#39;ve set up this file is that anytime we need to add a new controller, it&#39;s as simple as adding one new line. This will require the controller and initialize it.</p>\n<p>Now, we&#39;ll need to create a new directory at <code>/assets/js/controllers</code>. Inside our new folder, we&#39;ll make a file named <code>listCtrl.js</code>. The listCtrl.js file should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define(function () {\n    return [&#39;$scope&#39;, function($scope) {\n        $scope.addItem = function () {\n            console.log(&#39;addItem&#39;);\n        };\n        $scope.removeItems = function () {\n            console.log(&#39;removeItems&#39;);\n        };\n        $scope.items = [{\n            description: &#39;Do a thing&#39;,\n            completed: true\n        }, {\n            description: &#39;Do another thing&#39;,\n            completed: false\n        }, {\n            description: &#39;Do a third thing&#39;,\n            completed: false\n        }];\n    }];\n});</code></pre>\n<p>So there we go. Each of our controller AMD modules will just return an array with the dependencies as the items in the array and a function as the last item, just like a regular Angular controller except the controller is being initialized in the controller.js file, not on an individual module basis.</p>\n<p>We are adding an array of &quot;items&quot; to the <code>$scope</code>. We also went ahead and stubbed out a couple of methods for the buttons. They&#39;ll just do a console.log for now, but we&#39;ll get them working soon.</p>\n<p>Now we have Angular controllers on top of our Sails app. At this point, the app should look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/angular-controllers-with-sails-app2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Next time we&#39;ll start getting real data on the app.</p>\n<p>If you want to see the point our sample app should be at by now, check out the Github repo <a href=\"https://github.com/tysoncadenhead/sails-angular-example-app/tree/12d1e1860f0c1ae5acead7f6011059ce6b637375\">at this point</a>.</p>\n"},"adding-dependencies":{"published":true,"series":"Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js","part":4,"title":"Adding Dependencies","tags":["sailsjs","angular"],"category":"code","date":"5-30-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/adding-the-dependencies.png","yield":"<div class=\"series-placement\">\n\n    This is part 4 of the <a href=\"/blog/sails-ninja-intro\">Creating An Application With Sails, Angular and Require.js</a> blog series.

If you haven&#39;t used RequireJS or a similar AMD loader before, let me just say that you are really missing out. RequireJS lets you write your code in small modules that only expose the parts of the API that you want to show and as an added bonus, it uses JavaScript to load your JavaScript modules.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p><img src=\"http://bower.io/img/bower-logo.png\" width=\"250px\" /></p>\n<h4>We Can Use Bower, Right?</h4>\n<p>Before we get started, I wanted to give a quick rant about why using bower in a Sails project hasn&#39;t worked very well for me. <a href=\"http://bower.io\">Bower</a> is a package manager for client-side JavaScript much like <a href=\"http://www.npmjs.com/\">NPM</a> is for server-side JavaScript. Typically, I would use bower to manage my dependencies for any project. The issue is that Sails doesn&#39;t run your assets right out of the folder you create them in. Instead, it packages them up with Grunt and runs them out of <code>.tmp/public</code>. That approach is really helpful if you have a compilation step such as converting SASS or LESS stylesheets to CSS or minifying your JavaScript. The issue is that it if you have a ton of files in your assets directory, as is often the case when you have installed bower packages, you will inevitably either get errors complaining about the number of files being processed or it will be painfully slow. Either way, I&#39;ve come to the painful conclusion that using Bower with Sails is more trouble than it is worth.</p>\n<p>My compromise is typically to load my vendor files from a CDN whenever there is one instead of junking up my project with code that I didn&#39;t write.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ianreah.com/img/requirejs-logo.png\" alt=\"RequireJS\"></p>\n<h4>RequireJS</h4>\n<p>There is actually some debate about whether or not RequireJS has value in an Angular project. Angular has a dependency injection concept that makes running the code itself pretty modular. However, it doesn&#39;t load specific files for you out of the box. There are a few ways to leverage the Angular library to load your files for you. To me, though, it seems simpler to follow a set standard like what RequireJS provides by closely following the AMD spec. That way, developers in the future will have a clearer idea of where the code is coming from and how it is being loaded.</p>\n<p>So, let&#39;s get RequireJS working.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s open the layout.ejs file and add a line to instantiate our Angular application. We will replace the body tag with this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;body ng-app=&quot;todoIt&quot;&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The name of the app can be whatever you want to call your application, but just be aware that you will be referencing it later in your javaScript.</p>\n<p>Next, we need to go to the bottom of the layout.ejs file and replace all of the JavaScript files with this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;script src=&quot;//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.1.11/require.min.js&quot; data-main=&quot;/js/main&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>That will load the require.min.js file from a CDN and then immediately require your <code>/js/main.js</code> file. Don&#39;t have a main.js file yet? No problem. Let&#39;s go ahead and build that.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">window.name = &#39;NG_DEFER_BOOTSTRAP!&#39;;\n\nrequire.config({\n  &#39;baseUrl&#39;: &#39;/js&#39;,\n  &#39;paths&#39;: {\n    &#39;angular&#39;: &#39;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.16/angular&#39;,\n    &#39;jquery&#39;: &#39;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min&#39;,\n    &#39;bootstrap&#39;: &#39;//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/js/bootstrap.min&#39;\n  },\n  &#39;shim&#39;: {\n    &#39;angular&#39;: {\n      &#39;exports&#39;: &#39;angular&#39;\n    },\n    &#39;bootstrap&#39;: {\n      &#39;deps&#39;: [&#39;jquery&#39;]\n    },\n    &#39;socket.io&#39;: {\n      &#39;exports&#39;: &#39;io&#39;\n    },\n    &#39;sails.io&#39;: {\n      &#39;deps&#39;: [&#39;socket.io&#39;],\n      &#39;exports&#39;: &#39;io&#39;\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nrequire([\n  &#39;angular&#39;,\n  &#39;app&#39;,\n  &#39;bootstrap&#39;\n], function (angular, app) {\n\n  angular.element(document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;html&#39;)[0]);\n\n  angular.element().ready(function() {\n    angular.resumeBootstrap([app.name]);\n  });\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Notice at the top where we set the <code>window.name</code> to &quot;NG_DEFER_BOOTSTRAP!&quot;. That will keep angular from initializing until we tell it to. Near the bottom after everything is loaded, we call angular.resumeBootstrap(). That is where angular picks back up and finishes initializing.</p>\n<p>The socket.io and sails.io files that come with Sails are not wrapped as AMD modules, so we need to shim them both and export the io variable.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the main.js is pretty standard for a requireJS config file. </p>\n<p>We will also need to update the app.js file to this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">define([\n  &#39;angular&#39;,\n  &#39;sails.io&#39;\n], function (angular, io) {\n\n  var socket = io.connect(), app;\n\n  socket.on(&#39;connect&#39;, function socketConnected() {\n    console.log(&#39;Socket is now connected&#39;);\n  });\n\n  app = angular.module(&#39;todoIt&#39;, []);\n\n  return app;\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>We are leaving the socket.io connection. We&#39;ll be working with that later on. For now, we mostly just want to return our app as a new angular module. Notice that the name &quot;todoIt&quot; is the same as the <code>ng-app</code> that we added to our layout.ejs file.</p>\n<p>Now the main.js file will take the app that is returned from app.js and create an angular application.</p>\n<p>When you look at your console at this point, you should get a message that says:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">Socket is now connected</code></pre>\n<p>If you see that and don&#39;t get any errors, you have successfully added an angular application on top of Sails.

There are several benefits to taking this approach. First of all, I can host the site using any server environment. When I build it, all that I have are HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and they can be hosted with Node, Apache, IIS or any other server. Another benefit is that there are several places where I can host my blog for free.</p>\n<p>I ended up choosing to go with Github pages because this is a web development blog and I thought it was well-suited for their platform. This is how I got it working.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>First of all, it should be noted, that Github pages have to be served from the root of your project. For example, your domainname.com would serve up <code>./index.html</code>. So, to begin with, I put all of my templates, css, javascript and markdown files in a subfolder named &quot;_harp&quot;.</p>\n<h3>Serving Harp Locally</h3>\n<p>Next, I opened my <code>.profile</code> file in the terminal and created an alias to start up the server without needing to manually navigate into the _harp directory:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">alias tyson_run=&#39;cd ~/Sites/apps/tysoncadenhead.com; harp server;&#39;;</code></pre>\n<p>With that done, I just needed to call <code>tyson_run</code> and a server would be spawned at port :9000 with my blog. I know this part isn&#39;t really related to serving the site on Github Pages, but it is important to have a local testing environment.</p>\n<h3>Setting Up Github Pages</h3>\n<p>Github has a ton of documentation about <a href=\"http://pages.github.com/\">how to set up and run Github pages</a>, so I won&#39;t attempt to rewrite what&#39;s already been written.</p>\n<p>I will say that you need to remember to create a branch in your repository called <code>gh-pages</code> to push your blog to. Github will be looking for that branch to serve from.</p>\n<h3>Building and Deploying</h3>\n<p>I found myself repeating several steps every time I wanted to deploy my blog. First of all, I noticed that when I compiled my code, the static assets such as images, javascript files and the CNAME file, which is important for telling Github to use a custom domain were all missing. It was easy enough to copy them up a directory in the terminal, but it was needlessly tedious.</p>\n<p>I also found that with me being the only person with push access to my repo, I was never going to need to manage merge conflicts, so adding the files, committing them and pushing was needlessly verbose.</p>\n<p>Because of all that, I ended up writing a function in my <code>.profile</code> file that compiles harp, copies the static assets that harp misses, adds the files to the git branch, commits the files with whatever message I pass in as an argument and pushes the code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">function tyson_deploy () {\n        cd ~/Sites/apps/tysoncadenhead.com;\n        harp compile _harp ./;\n        cp -r _harp/images images;\n        cp -r _harp/js js;\n        cp _harp/CNAME CNAME;\n        git add .;\n        git add -u;\n        git commit -m &quot;$1&quot;;\n        git push origin gh-pages;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Now, I just need to run <code>tyson_deploy</code> and my code is pushed to the gh-pages branch. Any code in that branch is automatically served by Github, which means that after I push, my code is deployed.</p>\n<p>I have been really happy with harp as a solution. There are a few features I&#39;d love to see integrated, such as static paging but in the meantime, it works really well for my needs.</p>\n<p>Now, excuse me while I type &quot;tyson_deploy&quot; into my terminal...</p>\n"},"squash-stretch-and-bounce-with-css3-animations":{"published":true,"title":"Squash, Stretch and Bounce With CSS3 Animations","tags":["css"],"category":"code","date":"3-19-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/squash-stretch-and-bounce-with-css3-animations.jpg","slug":"squash-stretch-and-bounce-with-css3-animations"},"how-to-abstract-pub-sub-in-your-application":{"published":true,"title":"How To Abstract Pub / Sub Methods In Your Application","tags":["javascript","pubsub"],"category":"code","date":"3-18-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/how-to-abstract-pub-sub-in-your-application.jpg","slug":"how-to-abstract-pub-sub-in-your-application","yield":"<p>If you have worked on a large scalable web application, I probably don&#39;t have to tell you how important it is to keep your modules from directly referencing each other. There are several Pub/Sub libraries that have emerged to solve that problem. Some of the main contenders are <a href=\"https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS\">PubSubJS</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/postaljs/postal.js\">Postal</a> and <a href=\"http://amplifyjs.com/\">Amplify</a>.</p>\n<p>With several options to chose from, there is certainly value in abstracting away whichever choice you make so that you could easily switch the Pub/Sub library out without impacting the application. There are various reasons for switching libraries. Your library of choice might become unmaintained, or perhaps it will evolve in a way that doesn&#39;t suite your needs, or perhaps a better solution will emerge. Whatever the case, you certainly don&#39;t want to be locked in and have to change every file of your application if you do make the choice to switch at some point. Additionally, if you are using an AMD loader, you get the added benefit of not needing to require the pub/sub library in every module that uses it. This is how I have gone about abstracting my pub/sub libraries in applications in the past.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h3>Create a Pub/Sub Mixin</h3>\n<p>I would start by creating a mixin to use with my classes. This is basically just an object that extends methods to publish and subscribe to topics. Your methods might look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var PubSubMixin = {\n\n    publish: function (topic, data) {\n\n    },\n\n    subscribe: function (topic, callback) {\n\n    },\n\n    unsubscribe: function (topic) {\n\n    },\n\n    unsubscribeAll: function () {\n\n    }\n\n}</code></pre>\n<p>To flesh this out, the mixin might look something like this if we are using Postal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var PubSubMixin = {\n\n    _subscriptions: {},\n\n    publish: function (topic, data) {\n        postal.publish({\n            topic: topic,\n            data: data\n        });\n    },\n\n    subscribe: function (topic, callback) {\n        this._subscriptions[topic] = postal.subscribe({\n            topic: topic,\n            callback: callback.bind(this)\n        });\n    },\n\n    unsubscribe: function (topic) {\n        this._subscriptions[topic].unsubscribe();\n        delete this._subscriptions[topic];\n    },\n\n    unsubscribeAll: function () {\n        var self = this;\n        for (var subscription in this._subscriptions) {\n            this.unsubscribe(subscription);\n        }\n    }\n\n}</code></pre>\n<p>I basically just save a reference to all of the subscriptions in the <code>_subscriptions</code> object so that I can use the references to unsubscribe from any of the topics if I need to.</p>\n<h3>Mix the Mixin Into Your Classes</h3>\n<p>I typically don&#39;t just use the classes that my MV* framework gives me out of the box. Instead, I wrap them up so that I can extend them and add functionality for all of my modules.</p>\n<p>For example, instead of just extending Backbone&#39;s View, I might have an abstraction like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">myApp.View = function (options) {\n\n    return Backbone.View.extend(\n        _.extend(options, PubSubMixin)\n    );\n\n};</code></pre>\n<h3>New Up Your Classes and Enjoy Pub / Sub</h3>\n<p>With the backbone view abstraction using my PubSubMixin, I can call the <code>this.publish()</code>and <code>this.subscribe()</code> methods where I need them.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var documentRow = new myApp.View({\n\n    initialize: function () {\n\n        this.publish(&#39;document-rendered&#39;, {\n            rendered: true\n        });\n\n        this.subscribe(&#39;some-subscription&#39;, function (data) {\n            console.log(data);\n        });\n\n    }\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>While this example uses Backbone, it works just as well with most of the other popular frameworks. It is a great way to abstract your pub / sub calls so that you can use them when you need them to communicate messages across your application.</p>\n"},"exporting-canvas-animation-to-mov":{"published":true,"title":"Exporting Three JS Canvas Animations To MOV or MP4 Format With Socket.io","tags":["node","javascript","animation"],"category":"code","date":"3-17-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/exporting-canvas-animation-to-mov.jpg","slug":"exporting-canvas-animation-to-mov","yield":"<p>I have been a huge animation enthusiast since high-school. I even went to college hoping to become a professional computer animator before I got sucked into the wild world of computer programming. I have recently been dabbling with <a href=\"http://threejs.org/\">Three JS</a>, which is a JavaScript engine for creating 3D models and animations for the browser.</p>\n<p>Of course, my interests go beyond just making games and website animations. I like that the engine is written in JavaScript and that it uses web technologies like the canvas and WebGL to render the models. To that end, I have been exploring ways to export animations I make with Three JS to an external video file that I could use to stitch together actual films just like any application-based 3D animation software like Maya, Blender or Lightwave. I know it&#39;s crazy, but I think this might actually work.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>So let&#39;s take the example that Three JS gives us for <a href=\"http://threejs.org/docs/index.html#Manual/Introduction/Creating_a_scene\">creating our first scene</a>. The markup looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;My first Three.js app&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;style&gt;canvas { width: 100%; height: 100% }&lt;/style&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;script src=&quot;https://rawgithub.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/build/three.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n            var scene = new THREE.Scene();\n            var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);\n\n            var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();\n            renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);\n            document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);\n\n            var geometry = new THREE.CubeGeometry(1,1,1);\n            var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x00ff00});\n            var cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);\n            scene.add(cube);\n\n            camera.position.z = 5;\n\n            var render = function () {\n                requestAnimationFrame(render);\n\n                cube.rotation.x += 0.1;\n                cube.rotation.y += 0.1;\n\n                renderer.render(scene, camera);\n\n            };\n\n            render();\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Now, if we want to export something in the canvas, we can use the <code>toDataURL()</code> method on the canvas like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">document.querySelector(&#39;canvas&#39;).toDataURL();</code></pre>\n<p>If you run that command in your console, you will get a link to the current frame you are on. It should be noted that the toDataURL() method is not particularly fast. But when has rendering animations ever been fast?</p>\n<p>So, if we want to capture all of the frames for a given length of animation, we should be able to use toDataURL() to output each of those URLs.</p>\n<p>Three JS runs all of the rendering through the render function, so we can output our images there:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var render = function () {\n    requestAnimationFrame(render);\n\n    cube.rotation.x += 0.1;\n    cube.rotation.y += 0.1;\n\n    renderer.render(scene, camera);\n\n    if (cube.rotation.x &lt; 3) {\n        console.log(document.querySelector(&#39;canvas&#39;).toDataURL());\n    }\n\n};</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that I put a conditional around the output to just give us the first 30 frames. We could do more, but the point is that you don&#39;t want to keep it spitting out frames forever if you want to keep your browser alive. If your animation isn&#39;t infinite like this example, it should be easier to figure out how many frames you need to export.</p>\n<p>Okay, so now we are exporting frames, but let&#39;s be honest, that can get tedious really fast. What if we could send the frames over websockets and have our server automatically save the png files to our hard drive in order?</p>\n<p>Our server should look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var app = require(&#39;express&#39;)(),\n    server = require(&#39;http&#39;).createServer(app),\n    io = require(&#39;socket.io&#39;).listen(server),\n    fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\n\nserver.listen(3000);\n\napp.get(&#39;/&#39;, function (req, res) {\n    res.sendfile(__dirname + &#39;/index.html&#39;);\n});\n\nio.sockets.on(&#39;connection&#39;, function (socket) {\n    socket.on(&#39;render-frame&#39;, function (data) {\n        data.file = data.file.split(&#39;,&#39;)[1]; // Get rid of the data:image/png;base64 at the beginning of the file data\n        var buffer = new Buffer(data.file, &#39;base64&#39;);\n        fs.writeFile(__dirname + &#39;/tmp/frame-&#39; + data.frame + &#39;.png&#39;, buffer.toString(&#39;binary&#39;), &#39;binary&#39;);\n    });\n});</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, we have created a socket.io event called &quot;render-frame&quot; that takes an object with the file and the frame number and it creates an image in the <code>/tmp</code> directory with the frame number as part of the name and the meta-data from the file as the content of the image. We&#39;ll also need to update the client-side code to this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;My first Three.js app&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;style&gt;canvas { width: 100%; height: 100% }&lt;/style&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;script src=&quot;https://rawgithub.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/build/three.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;script src=&quot;/socket.io/socket.io.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n            var socket = io.connect(&#39;http://localhost:3000&#39;);\n            var frame = 0;\n            var scene = new THREE.Scene();\n            var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);\n\n            var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();\n            renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);\n            document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);\n\n            var geometry = new THREE.CubeGeometry(1,1,1);\n            var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x00ff00});\n            var cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);\n            scene.add(cube);\n\n            camera.position.z = 5;\n\n            var render = function () {\n                requestAnimationFrame(render);\n\n                cube.rotation.x += 0.1;\n                cube.rotation.y += 0.1;\n\n                renderer.render(scene, camera);\n\n                if (cube.rotation.x &lt; 3) {\n                    socket.emit(&#39;render-frame&#39;, {\n                        frame: frame++,\n                        file: document.querySelector(&#39;canvas&#39;).toDataURL()\n                    });\n                }\n\n            };\n\n            render();\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Where we are basically just setting up the websocket and emitting the &quot;render-frame&quot; event instead of logging it and letting the server handle the heavy lifting.</p>\n<p>At this point, we&#39;ve gotten as far as outputting the images, but there is still no video. However, if you have ffmpeg, you should be able to run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">ffmpeg -r 60 -i /tmp/frame-%04d.png -vcodec libx264 -vpre lossless_slow -threads 0 output.mp4</code></pre>\n<p>Which will output the video using the frames we&#39;ve outputted.</p>\n<p>As you can see, even if there isn&#39;t an out of the box solution to export Three JS videos from the browser, it&#39;s really not that hard. It is totally possible to make animations with JavaScript that you could put on YouTube and premier at your next nearby film festival.</p>\n"},"javascript-life-ko-ninja-example-app":{"published":true,"title":"Ko.Ninja Example App - JavaScript Life","tags":["knockout","javascript","ko.ninja"],"category":"code","date":"3-14-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/javascript-life-ko-ninja-example-app.jpg","slug":"javascript-life-ko-ninja-example-app","yield":"<p>If you haven&#39;t used <a href=\"https://github.com/jcreamer898/ko.ninja\">ko.ninja</a> yet, it is a great little framework for building awesome Knockout applications.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve built a sample app to show how easy it is to build something with Ninja.

Don&#39;t run away when you see the creepy looking mascot on the GitHub page, Squire is totally worth your time.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>If you have used Angular, you are familiar with how dependency injection can work in JavaScript. Squire has extended this ability to work with any AMD module. The basic idea is that the module says that it needs &quot;x dependency&quot;, but Squire steps in and says &quot;well, actually I&#39;m going to give you y dependency instead, but you can still go on believing that it is x dependency. Silly you.&quot;</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s say that you have a module that looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Person Module\n\ndefine([\n    &#39;underscore&#39;,\n    &#39;friends&#39;\n], function (_, Friends) {\n\n    var Person = function (data) {\n        this.init(data);\n    };\n\n    _.extend(Person.prototype, {\n\n        addFriend: function (data) {\n            this.friends.add(data);\n        },\n\n        getId: function () {\n            return this._id;\n        },\n\n        init: function (data) {\n            this.friends = new Friends(data.id);\n            this.addFriend({ id: 223 });\n        }\n\n    });\n\n    return Person;\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Obviously, it would have a friends dependency.

You might also noticed that we used a library called <a href=\"http://sinonjs.org/\">Sinon</a> to create an empty function that could take the place of friends.add(). If you haven&#39;t used Sinon, you are missing out, it allows you to fake methods and return anything you want from them, which makes it a perfect companion for Squire.</p>\n<p>Last, we required our module using <code>inject.require()</code>. While the API does look exactly like RequireJS, it is passing the call through Squire for dependency injection instead of requiring the dependencies.</p>\n<p>Pretty cool, huh?</p>\n"},"dom-manipulation-is-so-early-2000s":{"published":true,"title":"DOM Manipulation Is So Early 2000s","tags":["jQuery","Knockout"],"category":"code","date":"1-31-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/dom-manipulation-is-so-early-2000s.jpg","yield":"<p>I remember when I first started playing with JavaScript in high-school.

If you have a central place in your code to handle this, you can do feature detection as needed to support differing browser implementations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://assets.diylol.com/hfs/21c/b1c/a9e/resized/procrastination-panda-meme-generator-should-do-something-about-it-never-mind-cant-do-it-ad6b8f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>So, what should I do?</h3>\n<p>One solution is to implement a DOM abstraction layer like jQuery or MooTools. That will handle most of your issues with scattered logic, but your code will still be fairly untestable without actually writing tests against the DOM.</p>\n<p>The good news is that the approach newer frameworks like Knockout, Ember or Angular are taking with data-binding can actually make this an easier task. You simply update the underlying observable data structure and the DOM will be updated automatically to reflect the changes.</p>\n<p>For example, compare these two approaches:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// With Just jQuery:\n$(&#39;#my-id&#39;).css({\n   &#39;color&#39;: &#39;red&#39;,\n   &#39;font-size&#39;: &#39;24px&#39; \n});\n\n// jQuery Test - Using the DOM\nconsole.log($(&#39;#my-id&#39;).css(&#39;color&#39;) === &#39;red&#39;);\n\n// With Knockout:\nvar css = ko.observable({\n    &#39;color&#39;: &#39;red&#39;,\n    &#39;font-size&#39;: &#39;24px&#39;\n});\n\n// Knockout - No DOM Required\nconsole.log(css().color === &#39;red&#39;);</code></pre>\n<p>That is much better. You can spin your own abstraction layer to make testing easier or you can take advantage of framework that can handle it for you. Either way, it will make things much easier.</p>\n","slug":"dom-manipulation-is-so-early-2000s"},"ko-ninja-socket-io-model":{"published":true,"series":"Ko.Ninja","part":5,"lastPart":true,"title":" Socket.io Models","tags":["knockout","ko.ninja","model","data","socket.io"],"category":"code","date":"1-17-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/ninja5.png","slug":"ko-ninja-socket-io-model"},"ko-ninja-http-models":{"published":true,"series":"Ko.Ninja","part":4,"title":"HTTP Models","tags":["knockout","ko.ninja","model","data","ajax"],"category":"code","date":"1-9-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/ninja4.png","slug":"ko-ninja-http-models"},"ko-ninja-model":{"published":true,"series":"Ko.Ninja","part":3,"title":"LocalStorage Models","tags":["knockout","ko.ninja","model","data","ajax"],"category":"code","date":"1-2-2014","thumbnail":"/images/blog/ninja3.png","slug":"ko-ninja-model"},"ko-ninja-validation":{"published":true,"series":"Ko.Ninja","part":2,"title":"Validation","tags":["knockout","ko.ninja","validation"],"category":"code","date":"12-27-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/ninja2.png","slug":"ko-ninja-validation"},"ko-ninja":{"published":true,"series":"Ko.Ninja","part":1,"firstPart":true,"title":"A Framework For Building Awesome Knockout.js Apps","tags":["knockout","ko.ninja"],"category":"code","date":"12-20-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/ninja1.png","slug":"ko-ninja"},"how-to-use-tor-with-chrome":{"published":true,"title":"How To Use Tor With Google Chrome","tags":["Security","Browsers","Tor","Privacy"],"category":"privacy","date":"11-22-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/tor.png","slug":"how-to-use-tor-with-chrome","yield":"<p>There are plenty of reasons to want to browse the Internet privately. Search engines and social media sites have been collecting our browsing for years in order to target marketing and advertisements to us. There are plenty of hackers out there who would love to get their hands on your data. But perhaps the most disturbing recent revelation about data collection has been the extent to which the NSA is actively gathering our personal information.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>Many naive people might claim that if we are doing nothing wrong, then there is nothing to worry about. It should be pointed out that those same people don&#39;t live in a completely see-through glass house. Why is that? Maybe privacy is more important to them than they might claim.</p>\n<p>For the sake of argument, you may have complete faith that every single person in the government is a perfect person and wouldn&#39;t ever do anything to harm you. Even then, you have to worry about identity theft, hackers getting access to your data, etc...It simply isn&#39;t something you should trust other people to take care of for you.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, I stumbled across the Tor software. If you aren&#39;t familiar with it, Tor allows you to browse the web anonymously by randomly choosing a remote proxy anywhere in the world. This means that when you go to a website, your IP address could potentially be traced to Alabama, Texas or Paris. In other words, it can&#39;t be traced to you.</p>\n<p>Initially I was a little bummed that the Tor download included a modification of the Firefox browser since Google Chrome is my current browser of choice. Luckily, I found a way to browse securely with Tor in Chrome.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;d like to get more security when you browse, here are the steps you can follow to get Tor running in Chrome.</p>\n<h3>Download and Install Tor</h3>\n<p>Tor is available for download on the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en\">Tor website</a>. Start by downloading it and installing it on your machine.</p>\n<h3>Install Proxy SwitchySharp In the Google Chrome Web Store</h3>\n<p>Proxy SwitchySharp is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to switch out your proxy on the fly. It is available <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchysharp/dpplabbmogkhghncfbfdeeokoefdjegm?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon\">in the Google Chrome Web Store</a>. Install it.</p>\n<h3>Start Tor</h3>\n<p>If you open the Tor browser that you just download, you will see a control panel that looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/tor1.png\" alt=\"Tor Browser Control Panel\"></p>\n<p>Click on the button to start the server.</p>\n<h3>Find your port</h3>\n<p>From the Tor control panel, click on the &quot;settings&quot; button. From there click on &quot;advanced&quot; and find the &quot;Edit current torrc&quot; button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/tor2.png\" alt=\"Tor Advanced Settings\"></p>\n<p>The &quot;Edit current torrc&quot; button should open a configuration file like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/tor3.png\" alt=\"Torrc\"></p>\n<p>Copy the port number labeled &quot;SocksPort&quot;. We&#39;ll need that in a minute.</p>\n<h3>Open the SwitchySharp Options</h3>\n<p>In Chrome, the SwitchySharp options icon should look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/tor4.png\" alt=\"SwitchySharp Icon\"></p>\n<p>Click on it and then click on &quot;options&quot;.</p>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>In the SwitchySharp control panel, under &quot;manual configuration&quot;, add &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; to your &quot;SOCKS host&quot; and add the port number you copied from you Torrc file as the SOCKS host port number.</p>\n<p>Add an easy to understand profile name such as &quot;tor&quot;.</p>\n<p>Your configuration should look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/tor5.png\" alt=\"SwitchySharp Tor Configuration\"></p>\n<p>Click &quot;Save&quot;.</p>\n<p>Now if you click on the icon for your SwitchySharp plugin again, you should be able to select the &quot;tor&quot; connection that you just created. Try going to an ip sniffing site like <a href=\"http://whatismyip.com\">whatismyip.com</a>. Your IP address should now be masked.</p>\n<h3>Congratulations, you&#39;ve just become anonymous.</h3>\n<p>It should be noted that your IP Address isn&#39;t the only way your identity can become compromised. Tor has a short list of <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#warning\">additional steps</a> you should take to ensure your privacy.</p>\n<p>For the sake of full disclosure, I haven&#39;t gotten to the point where I use Tor all the time. It can be a little slower than hitting websites with a direct connection. But the benefits definitely outweigh the drawbacks in my opinion. I&#39;ve also taken a few more steps like switching my default search engine to <a href=\"http://duckduckgo.com\">duckduckgo</a>, which doesn&#39;t collect browsing data like Google does. Privacy is a big thing to take on, but any small steps that you can take are probably worthwhile.</p>\n"},"authentication-in-meteor":{"published":true,"title":"Authentication in Meteor","tags":["Meteor","Node","Authentication"],"category":"code","date":"11-14-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/meteor-authentication.png","slug":"authentication-in-meteor","yield":"<p>Authentication can be something of a road-blocker in application development. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve had a great idea for an app, but instead of jumping in and writing the core functionality, I try to tackle the authentication layer first. The problem is that once I&#39;ve gotten authentication in place, my excitement for the project has faded because I wasn&#39;t working on the project itself, just trying to set up a login system. Meteor takes the work out of setting up authentication so that you can focus on more important things, like writing the core functionality for your app.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>Meteor has a really robust account and password API, but we won&#39;t cover all of it here. We are just going to focus on getting something in place really fast. The reason for that is because we don&#39;t want to spend a lot of time working on authentication on the front-end, we want to work on core functionality.</p>\n<p>To work with authentication in Meteor, you will need to install the base accounts module.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">meteor add accounts-base</code></pre>\n<p>Meteor also has a pre-built user interface for accounts. If you want to go back later and make the UI different, you can, but for us to take a &quot;failing forward&quot; approach to development, it makes sense to just use the default UI and then go back and refactor it as needed. Let&#39;s install the accounts user interface package.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">meteor add accounts-ui</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we will need to install one of the authentication systems. Meteor comes packed with authentication through Facebook, Google, Github, Meetup, Twitter, Weibo and with a username and password. There are also third-party authentication types that were not written by the Meteor team.</p>\n<p>We will start out with just the basic username and password.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">meteor add accounts-password</code></pre>\n<p>Now if you start up your site by running <code>meteor</code>, you&#39;ll notice that nothing has changed. It should still look something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/meteorauth.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In order to see your login UI, you will need to add it to your template. That is as easy as adding <code>{{loginButtons}}</code> anywhere in your template. If you want the buttons to go on the right side of the screen, you can pass that in an argument like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html4strict\">{{loginButtons align=&quot;right&quot;}}</code></pre>\n<p>Either way, though, the login buttons should be rendered:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/meteorauth2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When you click on the new &quot;sign in&quot; button, you should get something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/meteorauth3.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You now have authentication on your app!</p>\n<p>The templates also have a <code>{{currentUser}}</code> that you can use to determine if the user has authenticated or not. For example, if you want to display a navigation only if the user is logged in, that might look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html4strict\">&lt;ul&gt;\n{{#if currentUser}}\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/account&quot;&gt;My Account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/preferences&quot;&gt;My Preferences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n{{/if}}\n&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>When a user is logged in, your client-side JavaScript has access to a <code>Meteor.userId()</code> which is just a string representing the ID of the authenticated user. You also have access to a <code>Meteor.user()</code>, which will return an object with the user information. Depending on what authentication type you use, the content of the user object my vary. Both of those are available from the console, so you can log them at any time.</p>\n<p>Each user object also has a profile that you can add your own data to. For example, if you wanted to add some data to the current user, you could do something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">Meteor.users.update(Meteor.userId(), {\n    $set: {\n        profile: {\n            firstName: &#39;Linus&#39;,\n            lastName: &#39;Cadenhead&#39;,\n            favoriteColor: &#39;green&#39;,\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}, function () {\n    alert(&#39;user was saved&#39;);\n});</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to listen for an event to tell you when a user logs in or out, <code>Meteor.autorun</code> is your friend. This snippet will redirect the user when they log in or out:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Keep the current user logged in state\nvar loggedIn = !!Meteor.userId();\n\n// This is fired whenever the user logs in or out\nMeteor.autorun(function () {\n\n    // If the user logs in, redirect them to the profile\n    if (Meteor.userId() &amp;&amp; !loggedIn) {\n        document.location = &#39;/profile&#39;;\n\n    // If the user logs out, redirect them to the home page\n    } else if (!Meteor.userId() &amp;&amp; loggedIn) {\n        document.location = &#39;/&#39;;\n    }\n\n    // Set the current loggedIn status based on whether the userId is available or not\n    loggedIn = !!Meteor.userId();\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to add another authentication method, just install it with Meteor. The user interface itself will walk you through the necessary steps to get things set up.</p>\n<p>As you can see, authentication with Meteor is really quick and easy. In just a few minutes, you should be all set up and ready to work on the parts of your application that you care about. Yet another way that Meteor makes wasting time on tedious tasks a thing of the past!</p>\n"},"why-you-should-teach-your-kids-to-write-code":{"published":true,"title":"Why You Should Teach Your Kids How to Write Code","tags":["Rant","Kids"],"category":"code","date":"11-08-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/duck.jpg","slug":"why-you-should-teach-your-kids-to-write-code"},"javascript-copy-and-paste-events":{"published":true,"title":"The JavaScript Copy and Paste Events","tags":["JavaScript"],"category":"code","date":"10-31-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/clippy.jpg","slug":"javascript-copy-and-paste-events","yield":"<p>If you have ever wanted to listen for user events like pasting, copying and cutting on the clipboard, you will be glad to know that it&#39;s not that hard.

IE has a clipboard object on the window itself, so you can actually access it at any time. In case you&#39;re wondering, that is a pretty bad security hole because it means that as a developer, I can actually grab the contents of your clipboard any time you hit my website without any action from you. If you have sensitive data in your clipboard, your data can easily be compromised. It makes it easier for developers to access the clipboard, but at the expense of the users. But I digress.</p>\n<p>There is also a copy event. It&#39;s a little harder to work with because standard-compliant browsers don&#39;t let you muddle with the data before it is set on the clipboard.

If you want to take more control over getting and setting data on the clipboard, there are some Flash hacks like <a href=\"https://github.com/zeroclipboard/zeroclipboard\">Zero Clipboard</a> that will let you add buttons to your page to copy and paste, but then the problem is that your buttons may not work on mobile devices.</p>\n<p>These aren&#39;t necessarily JavaScript events you will need to use on a day to day basis, but they can be useful to have in your bag of tricks.</p>\n"},"getting-started-with-socket-io":{"published":true,"title":"Getting Started with Socket.io","tags":["node","socketio","javascript"],"category":"code","date":"10-25-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/socket-io.jpg","slug":"getting-started-with-socket-io","yield":"<p>In the old days, if you wanted to get up-to-date data from the sever, you would need to set an interval on the client-side and continuously make Ajax calls to see if new data was available. The problem is that the data was never exactly real time. It was just what had been fetched every fifteen seconds or so. If you pinged the server too often, you would create needless overhead and there may or may not even be new data for the client to consume. The problems with this sort of approach are obvious.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>The answer to the old data pinging method is Socket.io. With Socket.io, the client and the server are able to communicate in real   time by sending messages back and forth. Because of its real-time nature, Socket.io has some awesome implications for chat, instant collaboration and game development. In fact, anything that could benefit from being real time would do itself a service to be using Socket.io.</p>\n<h3>So how can you get started using Socket.io?</h3>\n<p>First of all, you&#39;ll need to have <a href=\"http://nodejs.org\">NodeJS</a> installed. Once you have Node, you can install Socket.io with npm.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install socket.io</code></pre>\n<p>For the sake of setting up a server quickly, we&#39;ll also install Express. You can obviously run Socket.io on a server you create yourself, but Express makes it much easier.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install express</code></pre>\n<h3>server.js</h3>\n<p>Since Socket.io uses the server-side and the client-side to communicate, you will need to set it up on both sides. The <code>server.js</code> file might look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nvar express = require(&#39;express&#39;),\n      app = express(),\n      server = require(&#39;http&#39;).createServer(app),\n      io = require(&#39;socket.io&#39;).listen(server),\n      messages = [],\n      sockets = [];\n\napp.use( express.static(__dirname + &#39;/public&#39;));\n\nserver.listen(4000);</code></pre>\n<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with Express applications, all we&#39;ve done so far is set up the express server to serve up static files from the /public directory. We&#39;ve also imported Socket.io and created an array to hold the messages we&#39;ll get from the client-side and another array to hold the socket connections we make.</p>\n<p>Now, let&#39;s set up the server-side socket.io listeners.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nio.sockets.on(&#39;connection&#39;, function (socket) {\n\n  sockets.push(socket);\n\n  socket.emit(&#39;messages-available&#39;, messages);\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Every time a client-side connection is made, the &quot;connection&quot; event is fired. The socket that has been connected is passed in as the first argument of the callback. We&#39;ll store a reference to the new socket in the array of sockets we have already set up. Then we will use <code>socket.emit</code> to emit a message to the client-side with an array of all of the messages that are currently available. Of course, it will initially be an empty array, so we will switch over to the client-side so we can start actually saving messages to the server.</p>\n<p>If you save your file as <code>server.js</code> and run <code>node server</code>, you should be able to access it by going to <a href=\"http://localhost:4000\">http://localhost:4000</a>. Nothing will be there yet because you need to put an index.html file in your public directory.</p>\n<h3>/public/index.html</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Socket.io Messages&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link href=&quot;http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0-rc1/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- The form --&gt;\n  &lt;form id=&quot;create-message&quot; class=&quot;well row&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;fieldset class=&quot;col-lg-8 col-offset-2&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;legend&gt;Socket.io Messages&lt;/legend&gt;\n      &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;Name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; class=&quot;col-lg-12&quot; /&gt;\n      &lt;textarea placeholder=&quot;Message&quot; id=&quot;message&quot; name=&quot;message&quot; class=&quot;col-lg-12&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n      &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Create Message&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-default col-lg-12&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/fieldset&gt;\n  &lt;/form&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- The Messages --&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-8 col-offset-2 row&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;ul id=&quot;messages&quot; class=&quot;list-group&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Messages go here --&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Third Party Dependencies --&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.1.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;http://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0-rc1/js/bootstrap.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Socket.io --&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;/socket.io/socket.io.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Our app.js file --&gt;\n&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The main thing to note here is that the <code>/socket.io/socket.io.js</code> file was automatically generated when you installed socket.io into your application. There is no /public/socket.io directory and there doesn&#39;t need to be one. Don&#39;t worry about it; it&#39;s automagic.</p>\n<h3>/public/js/app.js</h3>\n<p>Next, let&#39;s jump into the <code>/public/js/app.js</code> file that we are including at the bottom of the page. That&#39;s where we&#39;ll get our client-side and server-side talking.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll start out by connecting to the socket. Since we set the socket to run on port 4000 in our <code>server.js</code> file, we&#39;ll pass the string <a href=\"http://localhost:4000\">http://localhost:4000</a> into io.connect.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var socket = io.connect(&#39;http://localhost:4000&#39;);</code></pre>\n<p>Everytime that the server tells us that there is a new message, we&#39;ll need to add it to the DOM. We&#39;ll just create a reusable function to use jQuery to prepend the newest message at the top of the messages list.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function addMessage (data) {\n  $(&#39;#messages&#39;).prepend(&#39;&lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item&quot;&gt;&#39; +\n    &#39;&lt;h4 class=&quot;list-group-item-heading&quot;&gt;&#39; + data.name + &#39;&lt;/h4&gt;&#39; +\n    &#39;&lt;p class=&quot;list-group-item-text&quot;&gt;&#39; + data.message + &#39;&lt;/p&gt;&#39; +\n  &#39;&lt;/li&gt;&#39;);\n};</code></pre>\n<p>Now, we can create a listener to render all the messages that are already in the messages array on the server-side when the page is rendered. Remember, we are already emitting a &quot;messages-available&quot; event in <code>server.js</code> when the page is loaded. This will make use of that event.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// This will be fired\nsocket.on(&#39;messages-available&#39;, function (data) {\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++) {\n    addMessage(data[i]);\n  }\n});</code></pre>\n<p>We will also add a listener for each time an individual message is added. We will write the server-side portion of this in just a moment.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// This listens for any individual messages coming back from the server\nsocket.on(&#39;message-added&#39;, addMessage);</code></pre>\n<p>Last of all, we will need to send the form data to the server whenever someone submits it. We&#39;ll just attach a jQuery submit event to the form and emit an &quot;add-message&quot; event to the server-side. We&#39;ll pass in the data as the second argument of the socket.emit method.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// When someone clicks the &quot;Create Message&quot; button, we&#39;ll emit the data to the server\n$(&#39;#create-message&#39;).submit(function (e) {\n\n  // Don&#39;t let the form actually post to the server\n  e.preventDefault();\n\n  // Send the &quot;add-message&quot; message to the server with our values\n  socket.emit(&#39;add-message&#39;, {\n    name: $(&#39;input[name=&quot;name&quot;]&#39;).val(),\n    message: $(&#39;textarea[name=&quot;message&quot;]&#39;).val()\n  });\n\n  // Clear out the message value\n  $(&#39;textarea[name=&quot;message&quot;]&#39;).val(&#39;&#39;);\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>You might notice that Socket.io looks the same on the client-side and the server-side. Both places use the socket.on and socket.emit methods.</p>\n<p>At this point, our <code>public/js/app.js</code> file is done. It should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var socket = io.connect(&#39;http://localhost:4000&#39;);\n\nfunction addMessage (data) {\n$(&#39;#messages&#39;).prepend(&#39;&lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item&quot;&gt;&#39; +\n    &#39;&lt;h4 class=&quot;list-group-item-heading&quot;&gt;&#39; + data.name + &#39;&lt;/h4&gt;&#39; +\n    &#39;&lt;p class=&quot;list-group-item-text&quot;&gt;&#39; + data.message + &#39;&lt;/p&gt;&#39; +\n  &#39;&lt;/li&gt;&#39;);\n};\n\n// This will be fired\nsocket.on(&#39;messages-available&#39;, function (data) {\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++) {\n    addMessage(data[i]);\n  }\n});\n\n// This listens for any individual messages coming back from the server\nsocket.on(&#39;message-added&#39;, addMessage);\n\n// When someone clicks the &quot;Create Message&quot; button, we&#39;ll emit the data to the server\n$(&#39;#create-message&#39;).submit(function (e) {\n\n  // Don&#39;t let the form actually post to the server\n  e.preventDefault();\n\n  // Send the &quot;add-message&quot; message to the server with our values\n  socket.emit(&#39;add-message&#39;, {\n    name: $(&#39;input[name=&quot;name&quot;]&#39;).val(),\n    message: $(&#39;textarea[name=&quot;message&quot;]&#39;).val()\n  });\n\n  // Clear out the message value\n  $(&#39;textarea[name=&quot;message&quot;]&#39;).val(&#39;&#39;);\n\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Now, we&#39;ll revisit our <code>server.js</code> file.We&#39;ll add a listener for the &quot;add-message&quot; event. When the message is added, we&#39;ll push it into the messages array and emit an event with the data.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">socket.on(&#39;add-message&#39;, function (data) {\n  messages.push(data);\n  sockets.forEach(function (socket) {\n    socket.emit(&#39;message-added&#39;, data);\n  });\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that we are looping over all of the sockets in our array. The reason for this is that each time a socket is connected, we only get a reference to that individual socket. If we want everyone to get the messages, we will need to emit our events to every socket that is available.</p>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve got that in place, the <code>server.js</code> file should look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var express = require(&#39;express&#39;),\n      app = express(),\n      server = require(&#39;http&#39;).createServer(app),\n      io = require(&#39;socket.io&#39;).listen(server),\n      messages = [],\n      sockets = [];\n\napp.use( express.static(__dirname + &#39;/public&#39;));\n\nserver.listen(4000);\n\nio.sockets.on(&#39;connection&#39;, function (socket) {\n\n  sockets.push(socket);\n\n  socket.emit(&#39;messages-available&#39;, messages);\n\n    socket.on(&#39;add-message&#39;, function (data) {\n      messages.push(data);\n      sockets.forEach(function (socket) {\n        socket.emit(&#39;message-added&#39;, data);\n      });\n   });\n});</code></pre>\n<p>As you can tell, there is really not much to it. Obviously, we aren&#39;t saving the data to a database. That means that if you stop running your server and restart it, the arrays of messages and sockets will actually be empty again. In a production scenario, you would probably be saving your data off to a database as the server receives it.</p>\n<p>Now that all of our code is written, we can start the server up and give it a try.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">\nnode server</code></pre>\n<p>Now, when you go to <code>localhost:4000</code> in your browser, you should see something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://content.screencast.com/users/tysoncadenhead/folders/Jing/media/211b507d-7fea-4eb3-8a15-9d332204f540/00000010.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The best way to see this in action is to open the page in two separate browsers at the same time and start chatting with yourself.

For example, I used it in a project recently to send status messages to the client while files were being uploaded.</p>\n<p>Of course, one of the more interesting applications of this technology is the ability it provides for collaboration in real time. We now have the ability to write applications that give people the power to interact with content seamlessly. Socket.io has the ability to bring people together in a way that no other coding technology ever has. And at the end of the day, isn&#39;t bringing people together what good technology is all about?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tysoncadenhead/socket.io-chat-demo\">Download the full demo on GitHub</a></p>\n"},"working-with-meteor-data":{"published":true,"title":"Working with Meteor Data","tags":["Meteor","Node","JavaScript","Data"],"category":"code","date":"10-10-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/meteor-data.png"},"why-is-test-driven-development-so-hard":{"published":true,"title":"Why is Test-Driven Development So Hard?","tags":["TDD","Test Driven Development","Unit Testing"],"category":"code","date":"10-4-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/tdd.png","slug":"why-is-test-driven-development-so-hard"},"getting-started-with-meteor":{"published":true,"title":"Getting Started with Meteor","tags":["Meteor","Node","JavaScript"],"category":"code","date":"9-26-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/meteor.png","slug":"getting-started-with-meteor","yield":"<p>When it comes to building applications quickly that share a ton of code between the client-side and server-side and that excel at real-time communication, there is nothing more awesome than Meteor. Meteor aims to remove all of the busywork from creating single-page applications, and it does a heck of a job at it.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>The cool thing about Meteor is that it lets you share your server-side and client-side code and it makes synchronizing data a snap. Meteor has a client-side database that it syncs with the server-side database behind the scenes, which lets you actually interface with the server-side database from the client.</p>\n<p>To download Meteor and get started using it, you can simply run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh</code></pre>\n<p>That will install Meteor on your local machine and you&#39;ll be ready to get into the actual app building. Meteor comes with a bit of built in scaffolding, so you can actually just run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">meteor create myAppName\ncd myAppName\nmeteor</code></pre>\n<p>and you&#39;ll have created an application and started the server to actually see it. By default, meteor is setup to run on port 3000, so if you navigate to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a>, you will see a page that looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/meteor1.png\" alt=\"Meteor Hello World\"></p>\n<p>You&#39;ll probably notice that tempting little button on the page. Go ahead and open your console and click it. You should get a message telling you that you clicked the button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/meteor2.png\" alt=\"Meteor Hello World Button Click\"></p>\n<p>So what is actually happening here? If you go into the <code>myAppName</code> directory you created, you should see three files. There is a <code>myAppName.css</code>, which is actually empty when you create a new app, <code>myAppName.html</code>, which is the templates for your application and finally, the <code>myAppName.js</code> which is where both the client-side and server-side JavaScript currently live.</p>\n<p>First, let&#39;s look at the <code>myAppName.html</code> file.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;myAppName&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n  {{&gt; hello}}\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\n&lt;template name=&quot;hello&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;\n  {{greeting}}\n  &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Click&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, it&#39;s a pretty standard handlebars template. You might be surprised if you go to the page and look at the source, though. Everything inside the <code>&lt;template /&gt;</code> tag will be missing. The reason is that Meteor automatically parses all of the html files in your project and pulls out all of the templates and stuffs them into a single concatenated JavaScript file. This means that you can actually put as many html files as you need anywhere in your project and they will be available for the JavaScript api to access quickly on the client-side.</p>\n<p>Now, let&#39;s look at the <code>myAppName.js</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">if (Meteor.isClient) {\n  Template.hello.greeting = function () {\n    return &quot;Welcome to myAppName.&quot;;\n  };\n\n  Template.hello.events({\n    &#39;click input&#39; : function () {\n      // template data, if any, is available in &#39;this&#39;\n      if (typeof console !== &#39;undefined&#39;)\n        console.log(&quot;You pressed the button&quot;);\n    }\n  });\n}\n\nif (Meteor.isServer) {\n  Meteor.startup(function () {\n    // code to run on server at startup\n  });\n}</code></pre>\n<p>You might notice that this single JavaScript file is being used on the client-side and the server-side. Meteor has both a <code>Meteor.isClient</code> and a <code>Meteor.isServer</code> boolean that you can check to see if you are running the code in the browser or on the server. Alternatively, if you put code in a directory called &quot;client&quot;, it will only be available in the browser. Code inside of a directory named &quot;server&quot; will only be available to the server-side. Any files in any other folders will be available in both the client-side and the server-side.</p>\n<p>The code inside of the <code>Meteor.isServer</code> conditional actually isn&#39;t doing anything. However, it does show that there is a <code>Meteor.startup</code> method. It&#39;s worth noting that the client-side has the same method, but it acts like the jQuery <code>document.ready</code> function - it just fires when the DOM is finished loading.</p>\n<p>Another thing to note is the Template object. Every template automatically gets an object named after it that is namespaced under Template. For example, since we have a template in our html file called hello, there is a <code>Template.hello</code> object. We can access any events that happen inside the hello template using <code>Templated.hello.events</code>. The events object expects the names to be structured as an event followed by the selector associated with the event.</p>\n<p>We can also add any parameters that we want to pass into our template on the <code>Template.hello</code> object. For example, there is a greeting defined in our JavaScript file that will be rendered in our &quot;hello&quot; template.</p>\n<p>That is the basic setup for Meteor. In my blog post next week, I&#39;ll show you how you can deal with data in Meteor.</p>\n"},"creating-sprites-with-compass":{"published":true,"title":"Creating Sprites with Compass","tags":["Compass","SASS","CSS"],"category":"code","date":"9-20-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/sprite.png","yield":"<p>One way to reduce the loading time of your website or application is to merge multiple images together into one large sprite. The benefit is that only one http request has to be made instead of multiple requests. Of course, managing a sprite image and the CSS that uses it can be a pain in the neck. That is where <a href=\"http://compass-style.org/\">Compass</a> comes in. Compass has a really cool helper that lets you import an entire folder of images and that it will automatically sprite for you.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>For some perspective on why Compass is a game changer, we have to look back on what it was like to create a sprite image in vanilla CSS. I remember when I first learned about <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp\">how sprites work</a>, I went out and changed a bunch of my sites to use sprites for all of their images and icons. Websites are constantly being tweaked and changed. Unfortunately, maintaining a big image with a bunch of icons turned into huge overhead because every addition meant opening an ever-growing psd file and editing it. If an icon was removed during the development process, I was forced to either remove it in the psd file and re-factor huge chunks of css, or leave it in the image and waste time loading sections of the image that were never even seen. You can see the problem.</p>\n<h2>The Compass Solution</h2>\n<p>Let&#39;s imagine for a moment that you are creating a website of cat pictures. You have a directory of two or three cat pictures that show up on every page of your site. Let&#39;s imagine that your files look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/catpictures.png\" alt=\"Cat Pictures\"></p>\n<h2>The easy way</h2>\n<p>If we want to use Compass to create a big sprite and spit out all of the images with appropriate classes, we could simply do this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@import &quot;cat_pictures/*.png&quot;;\n@include all-cat_pictures-sprites;</code></pre>\n<p>That will generate css that looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.cat_pictures-sprite,\n.cat_pictures-felix,\n.cat_pictures-phil,\n.cat_pictures-todd {\n    background: url(&#39;/images/my-icons-s34fe0604ab.png&#39;) no-repeat;\n}\n\n.cat_pictures-felix {\n    background-position: 0 0;\n}\n\n.cat_pictures-phil {\n    background-position: 0 -200px;\n}\n\n.cat_pictures-todd {\n    background-position: 0 -400px;\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>Generate individual sprite images</h2>\n<p>If you want more finite control over the classes, you can do something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">@import &quot;cat_pictures/*.png&quot;;\n\n.cats {\n\n  .felix {\n    @include cat_pictures-sprite(felix);\n  }\n\n  .phil {\n    @include cat_pictures-sprite(phil);\n  }\n\n  .todd {\n    @include cat_pictures-sprite(todd);\n  }\n\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Basically, by passing a name into the sprite, you can get the css for individual sprites. The above code will output something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.cat_pictures-sprite,\n.cats .felix,\n.cats .phil,\n.cats .todd {\n    background: url(&#39;/images/my-icons-s34fe0604ab.png&#39;) no-repeat;\n}\n\n.cats .felix {\n    background-position: 0 0;\n}\n\n.cats .phil {\n    background-position: 0 -200px;\n}\n\n.cats .todd {\n    background-position: 0 -400px;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>You should never have to worry about where the sprite image is located or what the background position is for any of your sprite images - Compass will manage that for you. Generating sprites with Compass is simple, straightforward, and best of all, maintainable.</p>\n","slug":"creating-sprites-with-compass"},"how-to-build-grunt-from-sublime-text":{"published":true,"title":"How to Do a Grunt Build Using Sublime Text","tags":["Grunt","Sublime"],"category":"code","date":"9-13-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/grunt-sublime.png","yield":"<p>Sublime Text is a really great editor for writing code.

If you already have NPM installed, you can just install it globally:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install -g bower</code></pre>\n<p>You&#39;ll also probably want to install Git because most of the Bower packages use Git to work their magic.</p>\n<p>Now that you&#39;ve installed Bower, you can go to the project you want to use it in and create a <code>bower.json</code> file in the root. It will probably look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;my-amazing-project&quot;,\n  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,\n  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {\n    &quot;jquery&quot;: &quot;&gt;=2.0.3&quot;\n  },\n  &quot;ignore&quot;: [\n    &quot;**/.*&quot;,\n    &quot;node_modules&quot;,\n    &quot;components&quot;,\n    &quot;bower_components&quot;,\n    &quot;test&quot;,\n    &quot;tests&quot;\n  ]\n}</code></pre>\n<p>If you&#39;ve already been using NPM, you&#39;ll probably notice that the format is pretty similar. The dependency object is where you will list all of your dependencies and the version you would like to use.</p>\n<p>By default, everything Bower downloads will go in the /bower_components folder in the root of your project. If you would like to put your dependencies in a different directory, just create a <code>.bowerrc</code> file with the path to your alternate folder:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  &quot;directory&quot; : &quot;public/js/bower_components&quot;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Once everything is set up, you can install all of your dependencies using</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">bower install</code></pre>\n<p>All of your dependencies will go into the directory you declare in your .bowerrc file or in bower_components if none is specified.</p>\n<p>To install a specific package, you can use</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">bower install jquery</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">bower install jquery#2.0.3</code></pre>\n<p>It&#39;s best to list your dependencies in the bower.json file, though, so that they will be remembered for later on.</p>\n<p>I have found that most of the libraries I&#39;ve needed are already registered with Bower. However, if you need to register a new GitHub repository, you can simply run something like</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">bower register jquery git://github.com/jquery/jquery</code></pre>\n<p>Simply pass in the name of the package and the path to the repository on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I&#39;m a big fan of Bower. Has anyone else been using Bower or something like it to manage third-party libraries on the client-side?</p>\n"},"logging-time-on-the-developer-console":{"published":true,"title":"Logging Time on the Developer Console","tags":["JavaScript"],"category":"code","date":"7-29-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/time.png","slug":"logging-time-on-the-developer-console"},"javascript-test-coverage-with-jscoverage":{"published":true,"title":"Determining JavaScript Test Coverage with JSCover","tags":["Testing"],"category":"code","date":"7-18-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/cover.png","slug":"javascript-test-coverage-with-jscoverage","yield":"<p>Knowing what parts of your code to test can sometimes be tricky.

Here are a few things that have come to mind.</p>\n<h3>Start with a plan</h3>\n<p>If you don&#39;t have a solid plan going into a garden, you won&#39;t know what to plant or when to plant it. I ended up adjusting my plan as I began to see what my needs would be and what would be practical for my space.</p>\n<p>Web applications are very similar. If you don&#39;t know what you are buildings, it will be almost impossible to make it work. Adjustments will inevitably be made along the way, but it is always important to keep an active vision of where you want to go.</p>\n<h3>Sandboxing</h3>\n<p>There are some plants that will grow on forever if they have enough space. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to box certain plants off from the rest of the garden, so they won&#39;t totally take over.</p>\n<p>In a similar fashion, keeping certain modules of code separate from each other makes a code-base easier to maintain. It also keeps code from breaking other code that is seemingly unrelated.</p>\n<h3>Get the bugs or the bugs will get you</h3>\n<p>A good rule in development is to make sure you take care of issues or bugs before you go on to create new features.</p>\n<p>In a garden, if your plants are being eaten by bugs, it&#39;s not worth your time to grow more plants unless the bug problem is fixed first.</p>\n<h3>Water and sunshine</h3>\n<p>In a garden, for plants to grow, they need plenty of water and sunshine.</p>\n<p>In an application, you need plenty of users working with your product on a daily basis. Otherwise you will never know what is needed to move the product forward.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m sure there are a ton of other parallels between growing food and writing software.

I haven&#39;t hit it yet and my understanding is that it is pretty large, but it&#39;s still there. This task will only translate each word once even if it appears in multiple language files, so that will hopefully reduce the amount of calls you have to make each month.</p>\n<p>So, far I&#39;ve used this to generate language files for <a href=\"http://ckeditor.com/\">CKEditor</a> plugins and to generate language files for use with <a href=\"http://i18next.com/\">i18next</a>.

Technology is constantly changing and improving. The demand for people who can read and write code is constantly expanding. The laws of supply and demand work in the developer&#39;s favor since all of the companies are forced to compete for the limited number of people who can write code well.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>So, if you want to get into the development field, you may be tempted to enroll in a nearby college and get a four-year degree in computer science. After all, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXpwAOHJsxg\">everyone with a college degree does better in life</a>, right?</p>\n<p>In the interest of full disclosure, I&#39;ll start off by saying that I do have a college degree. College was a good experience for me. I made many friends I still keep in touch with today, I met my wife at college and I was able to learn under some really good professors. However, I have to ask myself whether I would encourage my kids to enroll in college if they were pursuing a career as a software engineer. It might be surprising, but my answer would be &quot;no.&quot; Here are my reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>College is expensive.</strong> This should be obvious, but college can cost an arm and a leg. When I went to college at a small private university, the tuition was about $10,000 a semester. The cost of college is rising at a rate that far exceeds the rate of inflation. There is literally no way a college student can pay for that out of pocket. As an 18-year-old, you can&#39;t understand the burden of debt or the way that interest works on loans. What&#39;s even worse is that many of my friends are unemployed or underemployed with the same debt load. Our family is on the <a href=\"http:/daveramsey.com\">Dave Ramsey</a> plan trying to get out from under the weight of student loan debt. The one lesson we have learned is that it is never worth it to borrow money.</li>\n<li><strong>Missed opportunity.</strong> Four years is a long time. It&#39;s impossible to calculate what you may have missed in terms of lost opportunity. If I had been working, even for minimum wage, I would have had enough money to buy a house at the end of four years.</li>\n<li><strong>Technology moves too fast.</strong> Other than basic principles of coding, everything that you learn in college will be obsolete by the time you get your degree. As a rule, colleges are typically a year or two behind because they are waiting to determine whether the technologies will stick. There&#39;s no reason to teach a class on a language that turns out to be a passing trend.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, if you don&#39;t go to college, how can you get a job writing code? Here a few ideas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn as much as you can.</strong> Pick a language and commit to thoroughly learning it. If you&#39;re looking for a language that will make good money, some solid choices are JavaScript, C#, PHP and Java. I would personally recommend learning JavaScript because it has a bright future. Books are a good place to start. There are also tons of blogs that can be invaluable resources. There are also weekly newsletters like <a href=\"http://javascriptweekly.com/\">JavaScript Weekly</a> that keep a running update of what is hot in the development world. To get started on a language, I would recommend just creating an application. You will learn really fast if you are actually writing functional code.</li>\n<li><strong>Meet other developers.</strong> If you live in or near a major city, there are probably several meetups and conferences you can attend. They are a great place to meet people. Ask them about what they are doing and where they work. Create relationships with people who are doing what you want to be doing. The odds of getting a job by filling out resumes are terrible. Almost all of the professional jobs I&#39;ve gotten were a result of networking.</li>\n<li><strong>Get an internship writing code.</strong> Since there is such a high demand for software engineers, many companies will gladly take interns under their wings. The benefits for the company are that they have the potential to eventually hire you on as a full-time employee, they get free or cheap work and they are able to look good in their community because they are teaching upcoming engineers.</li>\n<li><strong>Look into cheaper alternatives.</strong> Here in Nashville, we have a program called &quot;<a href=\"http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/\">Nashville Software School</a>&quot; that just costs $1,000 a semester. My guess is that there are similar programs springing up in other areas as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you should be able to see, college is probably not the right choice for an aspiring developer. Sure, there are some companies that require a bachelor&#39;s degree, but the vast majority would prefer four years of real-world experience to the insulated learning environment that a college provides. If you are able to land your first tech job, nobody will ever even notice whether or not you have a college degree listed on your resume. Learning to write code well is going to require a lot of hard work, but college is hard work too. In the end, you have to ask yourself what it costs compared to what you have to show for it in the end.</p>\n"},"compound-js-presentation-in-nashville":{"published":true,"title":"Compound JS Presentation in Nashville","tags":["Compound","Presentation"],"category":"code","date":"5-22-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/testtubes.png","yield":"<p>If you&#39;re going to be in Nashville on May 21 at 6:00, stop by the Interactive Developers meetup at Vaco to hear me speak about the Compound MVC framework for Node.

The first chapter, &quot;A Simple Task List&quot;, walks us through creating a simple TODO list application. This chapter focuses on some of the fundamentals of Sencha Touch such as how to use Sencha Architect, which is essentially a WYSIWYG interface for creating Sencha apps.</p>\n<p>Chapter 2 is titled &quot;A Feed Reader.&quot; It walks us through working with remote data proxies. In addition to walk us through using JSONP, it also introduces more sophisticated options like using YQL to serve up data remotely.</p>\n<p>Chapter 3 covers working with Sencha Touch in the command line using the Sencha CMD tool. I had just started using Sencha CMD on a project a few weeks before, so this chapter was especially interesting to me.</p>\n<p>The 4th chapter gives us some information on working with Sencha Charts. I haven&#39;t had the pleasure of working with Sencha Charts on any of my projects yet, and the last time I had worked with EXT-style charts was 3 or 4 years ago, so I was pleasantly surprised at how easy they are to work with.</p>\n<p>Chapter 5 guides us through working with Sencha.io, which is currently a free place where you can deploy Sencha Touch applications into the cloud. The cool thing about Sencha.io is that it handles all of the server-side database interactions for you so that you can totally focus on writing client-side code.</p>\n<p>Chapter 6 is about writing APIs that work well with Sencha Touch. It specifically talks about REST-based APIs since the Sencha Touch Ajax proxy is geared toward that.</p>\n<p>Chapter 7 is about working with external APIs that you don&#39;t write yourself. It specifically focuses on Foursquare and Google Maps.</p>\n<p>Chapter 8 is about using profiles, which is an easy way that Sencha Touch has introduced to deal with multiple devices and screen resolutions inside the same app.</p>\n<p>Chapter 9 delves into working with the native device camera. It shows you how to capture, store and display images on the mobile device.</p>\n<p>The 10th chapter shows how you can even use Sencha Touch to create a functional mobile game. It also provides some great insights into how the Sencha Touch controller can be used.</p>\n<p>This is a really helpful book whether you are just starting out with Sencha Touch, or if you have been using it for a while, but would like to improve your skillset. If you have already been using Sencha Touch, you may want to skip over the first few chapters, but there is still plenty to learn in this book.</p>\n<iframe src=\"http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=EFEEEE&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=EFEEEE&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=111111&amp;t=tysolloycade-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;asins=1849518904\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>"},"using-local-storage-in-sencha-touch-2-2":{"published":true,"title":"Using Local Storage in Sencha Touch 2.2","tags":["Sencha","LocalStorage"],"category":"code","date":"4-19-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/storage.jpg","slug":"using-local-storage-in-sencha-touch-2-2"},"knockout-observables":{"published":true,"title":"Knockout Observables","tags":["Knockout"],"category":"code","date":"4-8-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/observers.png","slug":"knockout-observables"},"authentication-with-compound-passport":{"published":true,"title":"Authentication with Compound-Passport","tags":["Compound","Node","Authentication"],"category":"code","date":"4-3-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/passport.png","yield":"<p>One of the most useful CompoundJS plugins is <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/package/compound-passport\">Compound-Passport</a>.

I haven&#39;t been able to locate a unified list of the WebDriver methods anywhere on the internet. I&#39;m not even kidding. The best that I have been able to do is look at the Java documentation and make assumptions based it.</p>\n<p>My main struggle was finding a way to execute asynchronous JavaScript in a browser and send a callback to the server-side testing suite once the script had finished manipulating the DOM or running Ajax calls.

Today, I am going to expound on how the routing works in Compound.</p>\n<p>If you are not familiar with how MVC work, I suggest you take a look at some of my older articles about <a href=\"/blog/javascript-architecture\">JavaScript Architecture</a> and <a href=\"/blog/code-seperation/\">Code Separation</a>. From here on, I will assume that you have a basic understanding of the place of controllers in the MVC paradigm so that the routing will make sense. Let&#39;s begin.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>The CompoundJS router is built on top of the ExpressJS router, so if you are familiar with Express, the syntax should look suspiciously similar. Your router will be located in the /config/routes.js file. It should look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">exports.routes = function (map) {\n    // Generic routes. Add all your routes below this line\n    // feel free to remove generic routes\n    map.all(&#39;:controller/:action&#39;);\n    map.all(&#39;:controller/:action/:id&#39;);\n};</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, the router above is setting some basic global rules. If we hit /users/create it will resolve to the &quot;create&quot; method of the users controller. If we hit /users/edit/12 it will resolve to the &quot;edit&quot; method of the users controller with an id of &quot;12&quot; passed into the method.</p>\n<p>To map all of the basic CRUD functionality to a Compound controller, just add:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">map.resources(&#39;users&#39;);</code></pre>\n<p>Yes, that is just one line of code, but it magically maps all of these routes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>users GET - users#index</li>\n<li>users POST - users#create</li>\n<li>users/new GET - users#new</li>\n<li>users/:id/edit - users#edit</li>\n<li>users/:id DELETE - users#destroy</li>\n<li>users/:id PUT - users#update</li>\n<li>users/:id - users#show</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That will cover many of your routing needs, but if you need to make a route go directly to a controller method, the syntax looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">map.get(&#39;users/login&#39;, &#39;users#login&#39;);</code></pre>\n<p>With the code above, you will be able to go to the /users/login URL and it will resolve to the &quot;login&quot; method of the users controller.</p>\n<p>To map your homepage, you can use map.root like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">map.root(&#39;pages#home&#39;);</code></pre>\n<p>The above snippet will map to the &quot;home&quot; method of the pages controller.</p>\n<p>The Compound routing is very robust, so you may need to read through the documentation to see everything that it can do for you.</p>\n"},"what-are-the-best-productivity-apps-for-osx":{"published":true,"title":"What are the Best Productivity Apps for OSX?","tags":["Productivity","OSX"],"category":"productivity","date":"3-5-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/multitasking.png","slug":"what-are-the-best-productivity-apps-for-osx"},"how-do-yo-make-a-compoundjs-app":{"published":true,"title":"How Do You Make a Compound.js Application?","tags":["Compound"],"category":"code","date":"2-27-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/compound.png","yield":"<p>NodeJS may still be young, but there are already several MVC frameworks popping up to run exclusively on Node. My favorite is <a href=\"http://compoundjs.com/\">CompoundJS</a>.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>Compound was written to look like to Ruby on Rails. In fact, Compound&#39;s original name was &quot;Railway on Express.&quot; As the defunct name implies, Compound runs on top of <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">the ExpressJS framework</a>. Some of the reasons to use Compound instead of simply running a vanilla installation of Express are that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compound provides a structure for where things are supposed to go and how they are supposed to be used.</li>\n<li>Compound uses the MVC architecture, which makes maintaining code much easier, especially for those of us who are familiar with it.</li>\n<li>Compound provides scaffolding so you can generate portions of your application from the command line.</li>\n<li>Compound ships with a library called JugglingDB, which abstracts the database layer of your application and allows you to use MongoDB, Redis, LocalStorage and MySQL interchangeably.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a few other Node MVC frameworks out there, such as <a href=\"http://towerjs.org/\">TowerJS</a>, but one of my favorite things about Compound is that it doesn&#39;t force you to write in CoffeeScript.

The scaffolding will create the ORM, controller, views, routes and tests for our budget categories:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">compound generate crud category name amount:number active:boolean</code></pre>\n<p>Let&#39;s break this down. The first argument after the &quot;crud&quot; is the name of the model. All of the arguments after the model name are the fields that the model contains. The fields can be cast to a type when they are divided by a colon. If no type is provided, Compound assumes the field is a string.</p>\n<h3>Start the server</h3>\n<p>To start the server, you can run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">compound server 8080</code></pre>\n<p>Compound will start the server using the port that you specified. Since we started our server on port 8080, we should be able to go to <a href=\"http://localhost:8080/categories\">http://localhost:8080/categories</a> and see the index page of categories that we scaffolded a moment ago.</p>\n<p>The index of categories should look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/compound1.png\" alt=\"Compound\"></p>\n<p>Out of the box, Compound uses Twitter Bootstrap to style the views. You can usually customize the views and get them looking pretty good with very minimal effort.</p>\n<p>Compound has generated all of the basic user interface from our one line of scaffolding instructions. You can use the interface to add new categories.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/compound2.png\" alt=\"Compound\"></p>\n<p>Once a category is created it will show up in the index.</p>\n<p>The scaffolding also generates a details view that displays more information about the category.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/compound3.png\" alt=\"Compound\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, Compound outputs a completely functional interface.</p>\n<p>If this introduction is useful to anyone, I&#39;d love to expand on it and get deeper into more advanced aspects of how Compound actually works.</p>\n<p>Is anyone else using Compound for application development?

It was meant to be primarily run by plugins. Authoring Anvil plugins is a pretty painless ordeal. Today, I&#39;m going to walk you through the process of creating an Anvil plugin. Once you see how simple it is, you&#39;ll probably find yourself writing plugins to make your own build more efficient. Let&#39;s get started.</p>\n<h3>1. Install Anvil</h3>\n<p>If you haven&#39;t installed <a href=\"http://anviljs.com\">anvil</a> yet, that will be where you need to start. If you already have Node installed, you will just need to run this in the terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install anvil.js -g</code></pre>\n<h3>2. Create a sandbox project to test your plugin in</h3>\n<p>It is usually helpful to sandbox your plugin development just in case something goes terribly wrong. The last thing you want is to run a build and have it wipe out your entire project. These things can happen. Trust me.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll create a generic project so we can rest easy.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mkdir anvil-helloworld-sandbox\ncd anvil-helloworld-sandbox/</code></pre>\n<h3>3. Create your sandbox build.json file</h3>\n<p>Anvil uses a file called build.json to determine which Anvil plugins will be used and how they will be used. The file will go at the root of our sandbox project directory. It can be as simple as this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">{}</code></pre>\n<p>In order to run our plugin, we&#39;ll need an extra line to pass in some configuration information. Our build.json will look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">{\n    &quot;anvil.helloworld&quot;: {\n        &quot;greeting&quot;: &quot;How are you today?&quot;    \n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>We&#39;ll revisit how to access the greeting we passed in. For the time being, you just need to know that you can use it.</p>\n<h3>4. Create your plugin directory</h3>\n<p>We&#39;ll create a directory called &quot;anvil-helloworld&quot; where our plugin will live during development.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mkdir anvil.helloworld\ncd anvil.helloworld</code></pre>\n<p>So, what does the anvil plugin need to work? Not much, really. A typical Anvil plugin directory would look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">/anvil.helloworld\n    /lib\n        plugin.js\n    /spec\n        plugin.spec.js\n    /src\n        plugin.js\n    build.json\n    package.json\n    README.md</code></pre>\n<p>It&#39;s less complicated than it looks. Let&#39;s break it down.</p>\n<h4>build.json</h4>\n<p>We&#39;ll be building our plugin with Anvil, so a build.json file is needed. For our purposes, there is no need for any configuration, so the entire file can just be an empty object:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">{}</code></pre>\n<h4>package.json</h4>\n<p>This is for npm (Node Package Management) to register the plugin. It should look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">{\n  &quot;author&quot;: {\n    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Tyson Cadenhead&quot;,\n    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;tcadenhead@appendto.com&quot;,\n    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;http://appendto.com&quot;\n  },\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;anvil.helloworld&quot;,\n  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;An example plugin for anvil&quot;,\n  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,\n  &quot;repository&quot;: {\n    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;git&quot;,\n    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;git://github.com/tysoncadenhead/anvil.helloworld.git&quot;\n  },\n  &quot;engines&quot;: {\n    &quot;node&quot;: &quot;~0.8.15&quot;\n  },\n  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;./lib/plugin.js&quot;,\n  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {\n  },\n  &quot;devDependencies&quot;: {\n    &quot;anvil.js&quot;: &quot;&gt;=0.9.0&quot;\n  },\n  &quot;optionalDependencies&quot;: {},\n  &quot;readme&quot;: &quot;## Anvil Helloworld Plugin\\n\\nThis plugin requires anvil.js version 0.9.* or greater.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n\\tanvil install anvil.helloworld&quot;,\n  &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;anvil.helloworld@0.0.1&quot;,\n  &quot;_from&quot;: &quot;anvil.helloworld&quot;\n}</code></pre>\n<h4>/lib</h4>\n<p>You won&#39;t need to worry about creating the /lib directory because you can use Anvil to build it from the /src files. One of the cool things about Anvil is that it is a perfect tool for building its own plugins.</p>\n<h4>/spec</h4>\n<p>We won&#39;t focus much on the spec directory here, but it is for your unit tests. I would recommend writing <a href=\"http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/\">Mocha tests</a> for any Anvil plugins that you create.</p>\n<h4>/src</h4>\n<p>This is where the meat of the plugin is located. Our &quot;Hello World&quot; plugin.js would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var pluginFactory = function( _, anvil ) {\n\n    return anvil.plugin({\n\n        // Name of the plugin\n        name: &quot;anvil.helloworld&quot;,\n\n        // Activity list: &quot;pre-build&quot;, &quot;identify&quot;, &quot;pull&quot;, &quot;combine&quot;, &quot;pre-process&quot;, &quot;compile&quot;, &quot;post-process&quot;, &quot;push&quot;, &quot;test&quot;, &quot;post-build&quot;\n        activity: &quot;post-process&quot;,\n\n        // [ &quot;-h, --helloworld&quot;, &quot;Run this helloworld plugin&quot; ]\n        commander: [],\n\n        // This is to configure the plugin with\n        configure: function( config, command, done ) {\n            done();\n        },\n\n        // This is always called\n        run: function( done ) {\n            console.log(&quot;HELLO WORLD!!!&quot;);\n            done();\n        }\n\n    });\n\n};\n\nmodule.exports = pluginFactory;</code></pre>\n<p>Anvil plugins are created using the anvil.plugin() method. Every pluginFactory gets the underscore.js library and anvil passed in as its arguments.</p>\n<h3>5. Run your plugin locally</h3>\n<p>To get anvil to use your plugin as a part of the build process, just navigate into the root of your plugin directory in the terminal and run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">anvil install .</code></pre>\n<p>Now if you go back to your plugin sandbox directory and run anvil, you should see it log &quot;HELLO WORLD!!!&quot; among the other feedback it will give you.</p>\n<h3>6. Get config data in the plugin</h3>\n<p>I told you we were going to talk about how to get our configuration data, didn&#39;t I?</p>\n<p>All of the config information is available in the this.config variable. For example, we can add the greeting that we had in the build.json file like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">run: function( done ) {\n    console.log(&quot;HELLO WORLD!!!! &quot; + this.config.greeting);\n    done();\n}</code></pre>\n<p>There is also plenty of helpful configuration information inside of the anvil.config object. I would advise logging the entire object like this so that you can see what is available:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">run: function( done ) {\n    console.log(anvil.config);\n    done();\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Some of the notable parameters are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>working</strong> - The path to the directory where temporary files are processed</li>\n<li><strong>source</strong> - The path where the original unbuilt project lives</li>\n<li><strong>spec</strong> - The path where unit tests live for the project</li>\n<li><strong>output</strong> - The directory where the files will live once the project is built</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The anvil.fs object also gives you access to the entire file system, which makes it easy to modify the files in your build.</p>\n<h3>7. Publish your Anvil plugin</h3>\n<p>Once you&#39;ve finished writing your plugin, you will want to publish it.  You will need an account at <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/\">npmjs.org</a> in order to publish your plugin.</p>\n<p>After you have an account, you can just navigate to the directory of your plugin and run:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm publish</code></pre>\n<p>Anvil automatically pulls in any plugins in the anvil namespace, so your plugin will be available if you run &quot;anvil list&quot; in your terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">anvil list</code></pre>\n<h3>8. Go make some awesome plugins!</h3>\n<p>The &quot;Hello World&quot; plugin that we just walked through is <a href=\"https://github.com/tysoncadenhead/anvil.helloworld\">available on Github</a> for you to poke around with.</p>\n<p>There is really no limit to what you can do with Anvil plugins, so go fourth and conquer.</p>\n<p>If you use this tutorial to create an awesome Anvil plugin, please let me know.

We were working against time to get an application finished before the dwindling money supply was depleted. In the end, we were not able to meet our mark. However, during my time there, I became known as &quot;the Machine&quot; because of my intent focus on our work.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>Staying focused on development work can be more difficult than you might think. The very nature of our work demands that we are constantly online, almost always available for chat or quick voice conversations and sometimes even working directly in Facebook and other social networks, which have a nasty tendency to pull us in every direction but productivity.</p>\n<p>Software development is tricky because most of the work is done in your brain. You have to constantly keep track of where you are in your code. You also have to keep track of how the code you are working on relates to the entirety of the application. A distraction that lasts even just thirty seconds can get you off track to a point where it takes fifteen minutes or more to re-familiarize yourself with the code. </p>\n<p>I don&#39;t feel like I deserve a nickname like &quot;the Machine&quot; because I do lose my focus more often than I&#39;d like to admit. It is just as easy for a well oiled machine to lose focus as anyone else. Lately, I&#39;ve been working on developing a list of guidelines that can keep me from going down the dark road of distraction. Here are a few things that keep me on track.</p>\n<h3>Make a list of what you need to get done</h3>\n<p>You could just write a list on a piece of paper each morning. I use <a href=\"http://wunderlist.com\">Wunderlist</a>. The key here is to leave your list in a place where you can easily see it throughout the day. Order your list starting with the things that you need to get done most urgently all the way down to the least important. When you get derailed, you can easily flip back to your list and see where you should be at. When something is finished, check it off the list. Start each day making your fresh list for the day.</p>\n<h3>Don&#39;t waste time on sites and social networks that don&#39;t help you reach your goals for the day</h3>\n<p>It is very easy to justify flipping over to Facebook to see if anyone liked your latest cat photo. The danger is that the newsfeed can suck you in. For me, it is helpful to entirely restrict my access to the sites that I know will tempt me throughout the day. I use <a href=\"http://selfcontrolapp.com/\">Self Control</a> for the Mac, to entirely block my access to sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for large chunks of time while I&#39;m trying to focus. Checking social networks can become a mindless activity, so it is sometimes necessary to not allow yourself access to them.</p>\n<h3>Schedule social media breaks</h3>\n<p>If you do need to keep up with things like Twitter or Email, it is better to schedule times to check them as well as times to keep them entirely closed. <a href=\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/\">Tim Ferriss</a>, the author of the Four Hour Workweek, suggests checking your email and even snail mail as infrequently as once a month. That isn&#39;t practical for most of us who are expected to keep up with clients and coworkers, but it can be helpful to block off once or twice a day for checking social networks and email. That way, you don&#39;t get into the habit of mindlessly checking them throughout the day. It also helps to schedule your tweets and Facebook posts. That serves a dual purpose of allowing you to post at prime-time hours and also allows you use a certain section of the day or week to make them and still give the illusion that you&#39;re an active social media user.</p>\n<h3>Wear headphones</h3>\n<p>Whether you work from home and need to tune out <a href=\"http://pbskids.org/daniel/\">Daniel Tiger&#39;s Neighborhood</a> on the TV in the next room, or you work in a traditional office setting and don&#39;t want to be distracted every time the guy in the next-door cubicle has a rant about Apple computers, keeping some music in your ears to drown out the chatter can be invaluable. It can also be helpful to take the occasional real-life break after a couple hours of focused working. I used to take a walk every day right before lunch. I really need to get back into that habit.</p>\n<h3>Prioritize things that can be done quickly</h3>\n<p>If you have several things on your todo list that can be done in 15 minutes or less, it can sometimes be helpful to do them first. That way, you can build up momentum as you enter into the bigger tasks. Personally, if I feel like I&#39;m really winning in the small things, once I get to the bigger things that I&#39;ve been dreading, they don&#39;t feel as intimidating anymore because I already feel like a winner.</p>\n<h3>Use caffeine</h3>\n<p>I always drink a cup of coffee in the morning and a cup of tea in the afternoon.

Perhaps a little known secret is that I have all of the sites hosted inside a single Wordpress installation instead of hosting a completely unique installation for each site. Sharing a common code-base for the heavy lifting has some great benefits.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<ul>\n<li>It takes up less space on my server.  Wordpress isn&#39;t huge considering what it does, but every 12.8 MB counts.</li>\n<li>It makes updates easier.  When there is a new version of Wordpress available, I can update it for all of my sites at once.</li>\n<li>Sharing plugins is nice.  Once you have installed a plugin for one of your sites, it&#39;s also available for all of your other sites without having to download it again for a separate Wordpress installation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So how do I host more than one site on the same installation?  I&#39;m glad you asked.</p>\n<p>First things first, you&#39;ll want to set up a local development environment. You&#39;ll use it to view your sites in locally so that you don&#39;t screw things up on your production server.</p>\n<p>If you haven&#39;t done this already, (download the latest version of Wordpress)[<a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">http://wordpress.org/download/</a>] and put it under your /Sites/wordpress directory. Go through the installation process.  For the sake of this tutorial, I will be using <a href=\"http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html\">XAMPP</a> for Apache and mySQL, but feel free to use whatever Apache installation you like.</p>\n<p>Once you have Apache running and have installed Wordpress, it&#39;s time for the real fun to begin.</p>\n<p>You will need to add a few sites to your host file.  If you&#39;re on a Mac, you can get there by opening your terminal and typing</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">sudo vim /private/etc/hosts</code></pre>\n<p>If you are on Windows, it&#39;s probably somewhere around:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">C:\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts</code></pre>\n<p>For the sake of this tutorial, we&#39;ll say that we are hosting two Wordpress sites for now.  One of the sites is a blog about my dog, Arthur, so the URL will be <a href=\"http://mydogarthur.com\">http://mydogarthur.com</a> and the other site is about my love of tea and will be hosted at <a href=\"http://teatyson.com\">http://teatyson.com</a>. In order to view these sites locally, we would add these lines to our host file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">127.0.0.1       mydogarthur.loc\n127.0.0.1       teatyson.loc</code></pre>\n<p>Now, whenever we go to <a href=\"http://mydogarthur.loc\">http://mydogarthur.loc</a> or <a href=\"http://teatyson.loc\">http://teatyson.loc</a>, it will direct us to our local machine. If you&#39;ve never done anything like this, just be aware that 127.0.0.1 is always your local IP address.</p>\n<p>Once you update your hostfile, restart your Apache server and go to one of the addresses you added. It will probably give you a message telling you that the location is not available. That&#39;s fine, because we still have work to do.</p>\n<p>Now you will need to open your virtual hosts file. If you are using XAMPP, it will be under /xamppfiles/etc/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf. You will need to add a few lines to tell Apache what directory to serve up when your domains are accessed.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\n    DocumentRoot &#39;/Users/wordpress/&#39;\n    ServerName mydogarthur.loc\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\n\n&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\n    DocumentRoot &#39;/Users/wordpress/&#39;\n    ServerName teatyson.loc\n&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The last configuration you will need to do is in the wp-config.php file directly under the Wordpress root. If you&#39;ve gone through the Wordpress installation process, there should already be a database connection set up. You can copy your database if you go to <a href=\"http://localhost/phpmyadmin\">http://localhost/phpmyadmin</a>. We will make a copy called &quot;mydogarthurs_database&quot; and another copy called &quot;teatysons_database.&quot; Then, we will replace the database connection in wp-config.php with a switch statement like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">switch($_SERVER[&quot;HTTP_HOST&quot;]) {\n\n    // Development\n\n    case &#39;mydogarthur.loc&#39;:\n        define(&#39;DB_NAME&#39;, &#39;mydogarthurs_database&#39;);\n        define(&#39;DB_USER&#39;, &#39;mydogarthurs_database_user&#39;);\n    define(&#39;DB_PASSWORD&#39;, &#39;mydogarthurs_database_password&#39;);\n    define(&#39;DB_HOST&#39;, &#39;localhost&#39;);\n    break;\n\n    case &#39;teatyson.loc&#39;:\n        define(&#39;DB_NAME&#39;, &#39;teatysons_database&#39;);\n        define(&#39;DB_USER&#39;, &#39;teatysons_database_user&#39;);\n    define(&#39;DB_PASSWORD&#39;, &#39;teatysons_database_password&#39;);\n    define(&#39;DB_HOST&#39;, &#39;localhost&#39;);\n    break;\n\n    // Production\n\n    case &#39;mydogarthur.com&#39;:\n        define(&#39;DB_NAME&#39;, &#39;mydogarthurs_database&#39;);\n        define(&#39;DB_USER&#39;, &#39;mydogarthurs_database_user&#39;);\n    define(&#39;DB_PASSWORD&#39;, &#39;mydogarthurs_database_password&#39;);\n    define(&#39;DB_HOST&#39;, &#39;localhost&#39;);\n    break;\n\n    case &#39;teatyson.com&#39;:\n        define(&#39;DB_NAME&#39;, &#39;teatysons_database&#39;);\n        define(&#39;DB_USER&#39;, &#39;teatysons_database_user&#39;);\n    define(&#39;DB_PASSWORD&#39;, &#39;teatysons_database_password&#39;);\n    define(&#39;DB_HOST&#39;, &#39;localhost&#39;);\n    break;\n\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, restart your Apache server. You should have a different database connection for <a href=\"http://teatyson.loc\">http://teatyson.loc</a> and <a href=\"http://mydogarthur.com\">http://mydogarthur.com</a>. Since everything, including the theme is driven from the database, you can easily serve up completely different content from each domain.</p>\n"},"top-10-backbone-plugins":{"published":true,"title":"Top 5 Backbone Plugins","tags":["Backbone","JavaScript"],"category":"code","date":"1-22-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/plugin.png","slug":"top-10-backbone-plugins"},"how-can-i-share-ejs-templates-between-the-client-side-and-the-server-side":{"published":true,"title":"How Do I Share EJS Templates Between the Client-side and the Server-side?","tags":["EJS","Templates","Node","JavaScript"],"category":"code","date":"1-15-2013","thumbnail":"/images/blog/sharing.png","yield":"<p>The release of Node.js in 2009 ushered in discussions about the endless possibilities for sharing code between the client-side and the server side. While there are several good examples of entire libraries working very well on both ends, most of the projects that are written in Node tend to shy away from sharing the meat of the application with the browser. I think that the real issue is developers being stuck in our ways. We are trying to write traditional web apps in a language that can actually go beyond what traditional scripting languages were even capable of.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>The way I am going to propose we build a Node web application isn&#39;t a typical MVC setup. However, if we are trying to be purposeful about sharing components, I feel like it really works.</p>\n<p>For the sake of this discussion, I&#39;ll be using <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express.js</a> and <a href=\"http://underscorejs.org/\">Underscore</a>. I will also assume that you are familiar with Node and have it running locally on your machine.</p>\n<p>This is what our folder structure will look like:</p>\n<pre><code>/app\n   /config\n   /controllers\n   /shema\n/public\n   /css\n   /images\n   /js\n      /models\n      /collections\n      /controllers\n      app.js\n   /templates\nserver.js</code></pre>\n<p>We will need to start by creating a project.</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir myProject\ncd myProject\nnpm init\nnpm install express\nnpm install underscore\nnpm install express-ejs-layouts</code></pre>\n<p>Now that we&#39;ve create our project and installed our dependencies, we can create our server.js file.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var express = require( &#39;express&#39; ),\n    expressEjsLayouts = require(&#39;express-ejs-layouts&#39;),\n    app = express();\n\n// Express EJS views\napp.set(&#39;views&#39;, &#39;./public/templates&quot;&#39;);\napp.set(&#39;view engine&#39;, &#39;ejs&#39;);\napp.set(&#39;layout&#39;, &#39;layout&#39;);\napp.use(expressEjsLayouts);\n\napp.listen(8080);\napp.use(express[&#39;static&#39;](&#39;./public&#39;));</code></pre>\n<p>Note that we&#39;re pointing our views to the public templates directory. We are also making the public directory serve up static files. That way, it can be entirely used by the client side.</p>\n<p>Next, we&#39;ll need to create our templates. We&#39;ll throw them into the /public/templates/people directory. We will add an index.ejs file that lists all of the people.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html4strict\">&lt;ul id=&quot;people&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;% people.forEach(person) { %&gt;\n      &lt;%- include show.ejs %&gt;\n   &lt;% }) %&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Add a Person&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;form id=&quot;add&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;input id=&quot;name&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; placeholder=&quot;Name&quot; /&gt;\n   &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Add&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The include tag is unique to the server-side implementation of EJS, so we won&#39;t be able to use /people/index.ejs on the client-side.</p>\n<p>Now, we will include a show.ejs in the same directory. It will render the individual people in the list.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html4strict\">&lt;li&gt;&lt;%= person %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>You may have also noticed that we have a layout listed in our server.js file. We will need to create a  /public/templates/layout.ejs file to provide our layout. The client-side won&#39;t need to use layout.ejs, but it doesn&#39;t hurt anything for it to be public.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html4strict\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n   &lt;head&gt;\n   &lt;/head&gt;\n   &lt;body&gt;\n      &lt;%- body %&gt;\n      &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; data-main=&quot;/js/app.js&quot; src=&quot;http://requirejs.org/docs/release/2.1.2/minified/require.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n   &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>If we were going to flesh out the entire folder structure I presented in the beginning, the next part would be split out between a model and a controller. However, we can just add it to the bottom of server.js file for the sake of simplicity. It will take any request to /people and render the index.ejs template with the fake data we pass into it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">app.get(&#39;/people&#39;, function (req, res) {\n   var people = [{\n      name: &#39;Pooh&#39;\n   }, {\n      name: &#39;Tigger&#39;\n   }, {\n      name: &#39;Rabbit&#39;\n   }, {\n      name: &#39;Piglet&#39;\n   }];\n   res.render(&#39;people/index&#39;, { people: people });\n});</code></pre>\n<p>The last piece is our client-side JavaScript. A real application should split this out into more pieces as well, but we will just put everything in our js/app.js file for this demonstration.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">requirejs.config({\n   paths: {\n      &#39;jquery&#39;: &#39;http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.min.js&#39;,\n      &#39;underscore&#39;: &#39;http://underscorejs.org/underscore-min.js&#39;,\n      &#39;text&#39;: &#39;https://raw.github.com/requirejs/text/latest/text.js&#39;\n   }\n});\n\ndefine([\n   &#39;underscore&#39;,\n   &#39;jquery&#39;,\n   &#39;text!/templates/people/show.ejs&#39;\n], function (_, $, Template) {\n\n   $(&#39;#add&#39;).bind(&#39;submit&#39;, function () {\n\n      var template = _.template(Template),\n          data = { person: {\n             name: $(&#39;#name&#39;).val()\n          }};\n\n      $(&#39;#list&#39;).append(\n         template(data);\n      );\n\n      return false;\n\n   });\n});</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, the above example reuses our template partial to update the display. This is obviously a very simple and contrived example of how templates can be shared, but the concept can be used much more broadly. There is probably no legitimate reason for any sensitive data to be openly viewable in a template, so making all the templates public should never be a problem.</p>\n<p>In the next few weeks, I&#39;m going to expand this discussion to address how this same concept can be applied to create a fully functional Backbone app that also shares models and collections between the client-side and the server-side. The main thing to remember when we are taking this approach is to not include anything that is sensitive in the public folder. If people can read your source code, they probably will.</p>\n<p>Has anyone else experimented with sharing code between the Node and the browser?

Due to cross-domain security issues at the browser level, making POST, PUT and DELETE requests can be a lot harder than you might think.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say for the sake of argument that you have a domain at foo.com that needs to interact with an API at bar.com.  You can easily get around the cross domain issues using JSONP, but the limitation is that since JSONP is a hack that pretends that the ajax response is just a normal JavaScript file, it only allows for the data to be retrieved through the GET method.</p>\n<p>My first thought on how to get around that issue was that I could use a hidden iframe to pass data into.  The issue with that is that iframes in different domains can&#39;t communicate with each other.  Or at least, they can&#39;t communicate very easily with each other.  In truth, the only control that the parent page has over the child page is the ability to change the child&#39;s url. The child page has absolutely no ability to communicate with a parent in a different domain.  In theory, that would make responding to an ajax call impossible, but the child iframe can render a child iframe inside of itself that can communicate with its grandparent using window.parent.parent</p>\n<p>So you see, we have the ability to do cross-domain iframe communication using a proxy file for the requested domain and a proxy file for the response domain.

It&#39;s a pretty thin book and I was able to breeze through it in the course of a couple of days.  It&#39;s a very basic overview of what you can do with HTML5, so I wouldn&#39;t expect anything as expansive and heavy as the 900 page HTML5 spec, which is probably a good thing considering that it&#39;s not fun or easy to read something that long.</p>\n<p>You get a taste of everything from video and audio and their current limitations to the canvas and the new HTML5 input types and attributes.

We&#39;ve all been to websites that opened several popup ads. That is always something to avoid.  Malicious and ad-happy sites have made it necessary for browser plugins and some browsers to block JavaScript popups altogether.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>But there are some examples where popups are actually necessary. The main thing to remember when it does become necessary is to make the popup window a response to a user action.  Usually a popup should be triggered by a clicking a link or a button rather than opening it on page load.  That way the popup is not instantly perceived as an ad and closed by your user.</p>\n<p>When using a popup does become necessary and you have exhausted every other options including more attractive modal windows and nothing works for the user interaction, the next concern becomes what to do when the popup is inevitable blocked.</p>\n<p>The answer may look very similar to a progressive enhancement technique, but I wouldn&#39;t consider it one since the browsers with a popup blocker enabled are often more advanced than those without.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll start out making a very normal-looking link that targets a blank window to open the site inside of.  That should look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html4strict\">&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot; id=&quot;googleLink&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Go To Google!&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>The link will totally work on its own without the aid of JavaScript, it will just open in a new window instead of a popup.  Now let&#39;s add the JavaScript.  The event listener is written in jQuery, but feel free to rewrite it using your library of choice or none at all.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">$(&#39;#googleLink&#39;).bind(&#39;click&#39;, function () {\n   var popUp = window.open($(this).attr(&#39;href&#39;), &#39;googleWindow&#39;, \n   &#39;width=600, height=300, scrollbars, resizable&#39;);\n   if (!popUp || typeof(popUp) === &#39;undefined&#39;) {\n      return true; \n   } else {   \n     popUp.focus();\n     return false;\n   }\n});</code></pre>\n<p>Popup blockers work by redefining the window.open() function.  Part of the beauty of Javascript is that you can redefine literally any variable or object.  If you even wanted to redefine the document object or the window object, you actually could.  So the popup blockers will typically make the window.open() function return either null or undefined, which means that we can create the popup as a variable and then test to see if the variable actually returns as anything.  If it does, we can assume that the popup opened and return false so that the link doesn&#39;t fire off.

The question?  Do JavaScript libraries need an abstraction layer?</p>\n<p>Just to clear the air a little before we jump into the discussion, if you are making a small website, this doesn&#39;t apply.  I&#39;m talking about large, scalable JavaScript applications.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>An abstraction layer is basically code that extends the functions that do the heavy lifting.  It is used so that you don&#39;t call the code that is doing the work directly.  For example, if you are using jQuery, and you want to make an Ajax call, instead of firing the $.ajax() function, you would call a different function, like <code>myApplication.ajax()</code> which turns around and calls <code>$.ajax()</code>.</p>\n<p>There are obviously some drawbacks to this approach, but there are also benefits.  Here are the benefits as I see them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your JavaScript modules become dumb to the JavaScript library you are using.  For all your modules know, you could be using jQuery or you could be using YUI, and frankly, they don&#39;t care.  All they care about is that they are calling <code>myApplication.ajax()</code> and they expect to do an Ajax call.</li>\n<li>Since the modules don&#39;t know what library is being used, you can easily switch out the library that you are using.  Is Prototype not cutting it for you?  Just switch out the code in the abstraction layer and you are suddenly using jQuery... and your modules are never the wiser!</li>\n<li>You get more control over individual library functions.  Let&#39;s say that the jQuery DOM manipulation is exactly what you need, but you need something a little different for Ajax calls.  You could even use the abstraction layer to point to your own homespun solutions.</li>\n<li>This approach makes your code more loosely coupled, which is typically a good thing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, with the benefits come the drawbacks.  Here are some of the drawbacks I&#39;ve though of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In a way, JavaScript libraries are already an abstraction themselves for the native JavaScript.  How deep does it need to go?  We could be getting into a ridiculous Russian doll situation here...</li>\n<li>Speed is always a concern.  Every time you create a function, it takes another fraction of a second to execute.  That&#39;s why you should never instantiate a function inside of a loop.  This probably isn&#39;t a huge concern when it comes to JavaScript library abstraction layers.  It may not even be worth mentioning, but when you are adding a function to call another function, it raises these sorts of thoughts.</li>\n<li>There is always the chance that things will get messy.  When you write your code, you may know that myApplication.save() does an Ajax call to save the information inside a form to the server, but what about the developers who come after you?  Also, without proper training, other developers will just write code the &quot;normal&quot; way on top of yours, making you have an ugly mixture of abstracted code and direct calls to the library functions.</li>\n<li>What is the chance that you are actually going to replace your library?  It does sometimes happen, but people who write in jQuery usually stay in jQuery.  The ability to switch out the underlying library one piece at a time is pretty awesome, but it causes one to wonder how often it is really a concern.  This same sort of dilemma happens on the client-side when Coldfusion companies decide to switch to .NET, but there&#39;s no way to facilitate the change so easily as you can with a JavaScript library abstraction layer.  Is it really even necessary on the client-side</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What do you think?  Do JavaScript libraries need an abstraction layer?  You tell me.</p>\n"},"parsing-coldfusion-json-on-the-client-side":{"published":true,"title":"Parsing Coldfusion JSON on the Client-side","tags":["JavaScript","Coldfusion"],"category":"code","date":"8-6-2011","thumbnail":"/images/blog/eskimo.png","slug":"parsing-coldfusion-json-on-the-client-side"},"fat-models-and-skinny-controllers-in-javascript":{"published":true,"title":"Fat Models and Skinny Controllers in JavaScript","tags":["JavaScript","Architecture"],"category":"code","date":"7-14-2011","thumbnail":"/images/blog/controller.png","slug":"fat-models-and-skinny-controllers-in-javascript","yield":"<p>I&#39;ve recently been thinking about what it would mean to emulate the MVC best practice of skinny controllers that started in the confines of server-side development within the much more glamorous language and beautiful JavaScript. For those of you who haven&#39;t read some of my previous posts, I am a huge advocate of using Model View Controller architecture in client-side code as well as on the server-side. I&#39;ve written in depth about what MVC looks like on the client-side, so I won&#39;t bother to delve into that explanation here.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<p>The basic idea of skinny controllers is that the models in the MVC architecture should really do more heavy lifting than they traditionally handel because the models are more reusable than the controllers, which should really be serving their proper role of directing traffic, or in the case of client-side controllers, listening for events and responding to them.</p>\n<p>Following the fat model, skinny controller mantra to its logical place in client-side code, the places where the model should do the heavy lifting are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Validation in the case of CRUD functionality and post methods.</li>\n<li>Type-conversions and data manipulation.</li>\n<li>Storing data in memory or in HTML5 databases to minimize server hits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The benefit of all of these being in the model layer rather than the controller layer, or worse yet, in the views, is that multiple events in the controller can easily tap into the same functionality, which cuts down on duplicate code and lowers the risk of making variations in type-conversion or validation.</p>\n<p>For example, if a view is hitting a JSON datasource to get information about a user, the JSON might look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">{\n   &#39;id&#39;: 1112,\n   &#39;firstname&#39;: &#39;Darth&#39;,\n   &#39;lastname&#39;: &#39;Vader&#39;,\n   &#39;birthday&#39;: 1256953732\n}</code></pre>\n<p>and our JavaScript model, which uses jQuery to make Ajax calls, might look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">myApp.Model.User = {\n\n    /**\n    * @function\n    * @param {Object} params\n    * @param {Function} success\n    * @param {Function} error\n    */\n    find: function(params, success, error) {\n\n        // This assumes that you are using a getter / setter to save data to memory\n        if (myApp.get(&#39;user_&#39;

I know that there are user interfaces that are legitimately bad to start with, but that&#39;s beyond the point of this discussion.</p>\n<p>As designers and developers, we make interfaces that provide wonderful user experiences.  After which our clients and sometimes even end-users will come back with items that simply have to be added to the interface.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the additions really are necessary and sometimes they aren&#39;t.  For the sake of discussion let&#39;s say that the additions actually are necessary.</p>\n<p>What happens when you have an interface that doubles or triples in visual complexity?  Practically speaking, it will make the user lose focus.  It will make them unsure of what they are supposed to do and how they are supposed to do it.  Simple tasks will take them longer.  In the worst case, they will give up on your interface and move on to something else.</p>\n<p>The people creating the software or making the decisions about the software may feel like everything they are adding is needed.  However, in the end, you have to let some things go.  Otherwise you are just another user interface hoarder.</p>\n<p>Here are some valuable questions to ask if you&#39;re planning to add something to an existing interface:</p>\n<h3>Is this really needed?</h3>\n<p>Some additions are important and others are not.  Something that is flashy or &quot;cool&quot; may not necessarily be something that will make life easier or better for your user.</p>\n<h3>Will this improve the user experience?</h3>\n<p>In many cases, the client is going to want to get as much information about the user as possible.  Information is valuable.   The more we know about our users, the more we can improve their experience in the long run.  The problem comes when asking questions to the user gets in the way of their current experience.  If you can, find ways to get to know the user without making them fill our lengthy forms.  Nobody likes filling out forms.  Forms are even worse on mobile devices without an external keyboard. If you want your user to submit a form, a basic rule is to make it short.</p>\n<h3>Does everything need to be shown at once?</h3>\n<p>If you determine that everything you&#39;re adding is important, perhaps you can make the interface a little easier by not showing the user everything at once. Forms are often easier to complete in short steps where the user can focus on one question at a time.  This also makes it easier for the user to react to form validation, because the problematic fields will be fresh in their minds.</p>\n<h3>Emphasize the things that are of the highest import</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m not here to give a lesson on graphic design, but if something is important, like a call to action, it should stand out.  The user needs to be drawn to it.  Once you start emphasizing what is extremely important, you may find that some of the less important things can be cut.</p>\n<p>Nobody is going to leave you interface or website because it is too simple.  However, if your interface is too hard too use, it will probably only take a few short seconds for your users to leave and never return.  If you want to give your users a rewarding experience with your application, you just may have to clean your house.</p>\n"},"jquery-mobile-vs-sencha-touch":{"published":true,"title":"jQuery Mobile vs. Sencha Touch","tags":["Mobile","jQuery Mobile","Sencha Touch"],"category":"code","date":"2-17-2011","thumbnail":"/images/blog/mugs.jpg","slug":"jquery-mobile-vs-sencha-touch"},"javascript-variable-casing-best-practices":{"published":true,"title":"JavaScript Variable Casing Best Practices","tags":["JavaScript"],"category":"code","date":"2-8-2011","thumbnail":"/images/blog/casing.jpg","slug":"javascript-variable-casing-best-practices","yield":"<p>JavaScript is a loosely-typed case sensitive language.

You see, JavaScript is a linear language.  Even files have to be loaded in a linear fashion to guarantee that you aren&#39;t calling any variables that are not already set.  That&#39;s why if you&#39;re using jQuery, you have to load it into the DOM before you load any scripts that use the jQuery library.

In this case, you could literally say that MyFunction equals &#39;Test.&#39;  You can also return the variable using the &#39;this&#39; associated with the function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function MyFunction(){\n    this.myVariable = &#39;Test&#39;;\n}\nvar myVar = MyFunction().myVariable;\nalert(myVar);</code></pre>\n<p>When trying to figure out if a variable will be accessible, ask yourself if it is on the same level (not nested in a function) as the place you are attempting to call the variable or if it is a parent (a function or more higher than the variable you are attempting to call.)

Whereas websites used to have only a couple of lines of Javascript code used in them, Javascript has evolved to a point where it often does a large part of the heavy lifting in Internet Application development.  With the evolution of Javascript, the code typically used on a site can often grow to a point where it is bulky hard to maintain if it is not properly constructed.  That&#39;s why the topic for today is on how to architect Javascript in such a way to make it easy to maintain. Javascript is a programming language, after all, so we should treat it with the same care and respect we would treat server-side code.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h3>Why do I need Javascript Architecture?</h3>\n<p>If you are the only person who will ever work with the code you are writing, you will at some point have to modify it.  It&#39;s a fact.  Code that never gets modified is a sign of a dead website.  In order to modify your code, you need to write it to be easily modified without breaking other things and it needs to be easy to find what you are looking for in order to change it.  If other people will be looking at your code, whether in a development environment or if you ever leave your current job and someone else has to pick up where you left off, it is crucial that your code be pristine.  So where do you start?  Glad you asked.</p>\n<h3>Pick a library</h3>\n<p>I recently saw a poll that said that 95% of developers were using jQuery, but there are several other Javascript libraries out there that are fast gaining popularity like DOJO, YUI, Prototype, EXTJS and Moo Tools to name just a few.  Why do you need a Javascript library?  Of course, you can do anything with plain Javascript that you can do with a library, but these libraries extend functions and methods that help you to do it using far less code.  Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you sit down to write your code, you can work have a starting place created by programmers who have devoted their time to give you the cleanest code possible.</p>\n<h3>Use a connection object</h3>\n<p>Think of the connection object as the central hub or location where your application gets, stores and updates it&#39;s data.  The key responsibilities of the connection object include initializing the modules and passing information between modules.  This creates what we call &quot;Loose Coupling&quot; between the modules, which allows the modules to be dumb to each others existence.  When a module object is updated it passes the connection object the new data and the connection object essentially shouts out to the other modules &quot;Hey!  Over here!  I&#39;ve got some new updates!&quot; The other modules may ignore the announcement or they may act on the new information, but the connection object doesn&#39;t care either way, it just takes in information and sends it out.</p>\n<h3>Think in modules</h3>\n<p>If you have a Google or Yahoo homepage, you know what I mean by modules, take any web application and imagine breaking it down into small pieces.  For example, on this website, you could break it down into a header, a sidebar and a footer.  The content portion could be broken down even further.  The comments could certainly be a module, for example.  Determine where the breakdowns occur and write your code completely separately for each individual module.  This can be broken down even further by using MVC design patterns to separate the modules even further.  The two best Javascript MVC frameworks that I have seen are <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/trimpath/\">Trimpath</a> and <a href=\"http://javascriptmvc.com\">JavaScriptMVC</a>JavascriptMVC. If you spend a large amount of time talking to me about Javascript architecture, you probably hear me drooling over JavascriptMVC.  I&#39;m planning to write an entire post covering the rich complexities of the JMVC framework in the future, but for the sake of this post, just let it be known that I like it because it assists in writing large-scale ajax projects.</p>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind whether you use an MVC framework or you just write modular code individually is that modules should never interact directly with each other.  For all purposes, a module should be dumb to another modules existence.  When a module needs to apply something other modules, it should be passed to the connection object that informs all of the modules that a change has occurred.  If any of the modules need the change, they will grab it from the connection object, not from the effected module itself.  This keeps the actions separate and keeps modules from being broken due to changes in other modules.  This greatly reduces the chance that your entire application will ever be effected by changing a single element of it.</p>\n<h3>Build a library connection object</h3>\n<p>A fourth measure of separation that I have read about but have to admit I&#39;ve never used is to write an object that acts between the library and the modules create loose coupling to the library.  This object only extends methods that are used by the modules from the library.  The idea behind the library connection object is that if the library is ever replaced, (for example, if you need to switch from Moo Tools to Prototype because it offers functionality that isn&#39;t available in Prototype), you can easily transition to the new library without having to re-write all of your modules.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re anything like me, you probably need something visual to show the work-flow I&#39;m proposing.  Here&#39;s a simplified example of what this might look like.  The arrows show what is being send in and what is being received by each object and module.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/javascriptarchitecture2.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration\"></p>\n<p>As always, I&#39;m only skimming the surface of this topic.

Isn&#39;t that the best way?</h3>\n<p>When I first started making websites, I was 13 years old.  This was just when the internet was becoming something more than a place for email and messaging groups.  I set up my first website, which was a Star Wars fan page on Geocities and I was very satisfied with it.  The problem was that within about a week, I  wanted to change my neon-green typefaces to red.  The problem was that I had hard-coded each of my headers to be shown in that brilliant neon-green.  I couldn&#39;t just flip a switch or re-write a single line of code and change my beautiful comic-sans typography, I had to go through every single page and change every single hexadecimal value.  This took hours.  It took so long, in fact, that by the time that I was done, I had changed my mind and decided that I would prefer a blue typeface instead.  This was before I knew anything about external style sheets, and in all actuality, I&#39;m not entirely certain that my early version of Internet Explorer would have even supported them.</p>\n<p>Fast forward ten years.  By this point I&#39;ve learned the importance of having separation in my client-side code.  I have all of my Javascript, CSS, flash, images and media sitting in their own tidy folders and I&#39;ve even gotten a master page and includes.  Let&#39;s even say for the sake of argument that I&#39;ve been able to stay away from writing inline queries to my database and I even have a code-behind file doing the actual work for each of my pages.  I&#39;m doing pretty good, right?  Wrong.  The code still isn&#39;t all that separated.  My code-behind file is a jumble of actions that the page is supposed to perform, queries to the database, whether inline or through a function, and display logic.  When you have an entire development team working to decipher and update code under these circumstances, you end up with confusion that hasn&#39;t been rivaled since the tower of Babel.  There has to be a better and cleaner way to create code, right?  I&#39;m glad you asked.  Enter architectural patterns.</p>\n<h3>What are architectural patterns?  Why do I care?</h3>\n<p>There are a large number of architectural patterns out there for development.  Some of the big important ones are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Model View Controller</li>\n<li>Model View ViewModel</li>\n<li>Model View Presenter</li>\n<li>Presentation Abstraction Control</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The basic idea behind all of these is to separate the coding logic into bite size pieces that can be easily found and manipulated and that link to the other related pieces correctly.  If you&#39;re a developer, these patterns will help you easily manipulate your own code and it will help anyone who comes after you as well.  If you are hiring a developer, it will save you money because instead of wrestling to get a project working, your developers will be dancing with the project.</p>\n<h3>What is MVC?</h3>\n<p>MVC is an acronym for <em>Model-View-Controller</em>.  In this design pattern, every page is associated with a model, a view and a controller, which can all be found in appropriately labeled folders.</p>\n<h4>Controller</h4>\n<p>When someone goes to a page, the controller is accessed.  It essentially acts as a traffic director, telling the browser what to do.  The controller will look to the model and to the view.</p>\n<h4>Model</h4>\n<p>The model handles all of domain-specific data.  If your application uses a database, the model interacts with the database and builds objects that can be accessed in the view and in the controller.  It passes the objects back to them.</p>\n<h4>View</h4>\n<p>The view is the display.  The view accesses any objects that are built in the model or in the controller.  Think of this as the display.</p>\n<p>This is just the very basic beginning point to understanding code separation and MVC.

    <h1>Javascript Variables' Accessibility</h1>

    

    <h5><span class="label label-info"><a href="/?category=code">code</a></span> | 8-24-2010</h5>

    <p>When I started writing JavaScript (and code in general, for that matter), one of toughest things for me to wrap my head around was what variables and functions I could access from where.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>For example, I would try things like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">alert(MyVariable);
var MyVariable = &#39;This is a variable!&#39;;</code></pre>
<p>The previous code would fail because the variable hadn&#39;t been set yet when it was called.  Instead, it should look more like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var MyVariable = &#39;This is a variable!&#39;;
alert(MyVariable);</code></pre>
<p>The previous code will work because the variable had been set before it was called.  You see, JavaScript is a linear language.  Even files have to be loaded in a linear fashion to guarantee that you aren&#39;t calling any variables that are not already set.  That&#39;s why if you&#39;re using jQuery, you have to load it into the DOM before you load any scripts that use the jQuery library.  I know that&#39;s pretty basic, but it&#39;s the starting point for the rest of this.</p>
<p>How about this example?</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function MyFunction(){
    var myVariable = &#39;Test&#39;;
}
MyFunction();
alert(myVariable);</code></pre>
<p>That example will also fail because the variable is created inside the function and the variable is being called outside of it.  There are a few of ways to access variables that are set inside of functions, however.  The code below will work because the variable is already defined outside of the function.  The variable is updated inside the function, but it is updated before we alert it and so it is still accessible.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var myVariable;
function MyFunction(){
    myVariable = &#39;Test&#39;;
}
MyFunction();
alert(myVariable);</code></pre>
<p>Another way to retrieve variables set inside a function is to return them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function MyFunction(){
var myVariable = &#39;Test&#39;;
    return myVariable;
}
var myVar = MyFunction();
alert(myVar);</code></pre>
<p>The code above will work because the function doesn&#39;t rely on any global variables and it simply returns the variable that is set inside of it.  In this case, you could literally say that MyFunction equals &#39;Test.&#39;  You can also return the variable using the &#39;this&#39; associated with the function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function MyFunction(){
    this.myVariable = &#39;Test&#39;;
}
var myVar = MyFunction().myVariable;
alert(myVar);</code></pre>
<p>When trying to figure out if a variable will be accessible, ask yourself if it is on the same level (not nested in a function) as the place you are attempting to call the variable or if it is a parent (a function or more higher than the variable you are attempting to call.)  If the answer is yes, then you will be able to get to the variable.  That&#39;s why something like this won&#39;t work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function MyFirstFunction(){
    var myVariable = &#39;Test&#39;;
}
function MySecondFunction(){
    alert(myVariable);
}
MyFirstFunction();
MySecondFunction();</code></pre>
<p>But this will:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var myVariable;
    function MyFirstFunction(){
    myVariable = &#39;Test&#39;;
}
function MySecondFunction(){
    alert(myVariable);
}
MyFirstFunction();
MySecondFunction();</code></pre>
<p>Any questions?</p>
