I have recently been diving into [Creating Mobile Apps With Sencha Touch 2](http://www.packtpub.com/creating-mobile-apps-with-sencha-touch-2/book) and I have really been enjoying it.

As someone who worked with Sencha Touch when it first came out, it has been fun to watch the steady improvements that have been added over time to make Sencha Touch 2, so I was doubly excited to have the chance to review this book.

*Creating Mobile Apps With Sencha Touch 2* is a very comprehensive guide for writing data-driven mobile applications, but it begins with the novice in mind. The first chapter, "A Simple Task List", walks us through creating a simple TODO list application. This chapter focuses on some of the fundamentals of Sencha Touch such as how to use Sencha Architect, which is essentially a WYSIWYG interface for creating Sencha apps.

Chapter 2 is titled "A Feed Reader." It walks us through working with remote data proxies. In addition to walk us through using JSONP, it also introduces more sophisticated options like using YQL to serve up data remotely.

Chapter 3 covers working with Sencha Touch in the command line using the Sencha CMD tool. I had just started using Sencha CMD on a project a few weeks before, so this chapter was especially interesting to me.

The 4th chapter gives us some information on working with Sencha Charts. I haven't had the pleasure of working with Sencha Charts on any of my projects yet, and the last time I had worked with EXT-style charts was 3 or 4 years ago, so I was pleasantly surprised at how easy they are to work with.

Chapter 5 guides us through working with Sencha.io, which is currently a free place where you can deploy Sencha Touch applications into the cloud. The cool thing about Sencha.io is that it handles all of the server-side database interactions for you so that you can totally focus on writing client-side code.

Chapter 6 is about writing APIs that work well with Sencha Touch. It specifically talks about REST-based APIs since the Sencha Touch Ajax proxy is geared toward that.

Chapter 7 is about working with external APIs that you don't write yourself. It specifically focuses on Foursquare and Google Maps.

Chapter 8 is about using profiles, which is an easy way that Sencha Touch has introduced to deal with multiple devices and screen resolutions inside the same app.

Chapter 9 delves into working with the native device camera. It shows you how to capture, store and display images on the mobile device.

The 10th chapter shows how you can even use Sencha Touch to create a functional mobile game. It also provides some great insights into how the Sencha Touch controller can be used.

This is a really helpful book whether you are just starting out with Sencha Touch, or if you have been using it for a while, but would like to improve your skillset. If you have already been using Sencha Touch, you may want to skip over the first few chapters, but there is still plenty to learn in this book.
