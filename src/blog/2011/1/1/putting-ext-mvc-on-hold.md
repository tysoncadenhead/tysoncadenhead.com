I'm thinking about putting my series on application architecture in EXT and Sencha on hold for now because the Sencha team has announced their plans for EXT 4.0 which looks like it will include a very nice MVC framework built in.

<!-- more -->

My plan is to restart this series when the new version of EXT comes out next year. I'm sorry for the false start here, but I really think this will be even better this way.
