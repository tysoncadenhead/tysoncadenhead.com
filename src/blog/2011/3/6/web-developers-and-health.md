It's no secret that web developers don't lead a very active lifestyle. In fact, from the day I entered college until a couple of weeks ago, I had gained almost 25 pounds thanks to my lack of activity and disregard for the effects of food on my body.

However, a couple of weeks ago, I started to turn it all around.  Already, I've lost several pounds and I'm starting to feel healthier.  How could a web developer loose weight?  Ironically, the answer is technology.  I've been using a free iPhone app from [loseit.com](http://loseit.com) to track my calories.

I've tried other calorie counting programs like [Spark People](http://www.sparkpeople.com)  in the past, but I was never able to get past the poor user experience and confusing interfaces to actually start loosing weight.

Loose It, on the other hand has a very intuitive interface, both on the app and on their website.  It's so easy that my mom can use it, and she does.  But it's also an excellent tool for the tech-savy person whose idea of getting out in nature is moving their desk in front of the window.

What do you do to stay in shape in the world of technology?
