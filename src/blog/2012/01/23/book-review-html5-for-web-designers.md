A few days ago I realized that I read a lot of books and articles about JavaScript and web development and that this would be a good place to share my thoughts about them both for my own reference and maybe even for helping other people out.  In the interest of that revelation, I present to you a quick review of HTML5 for Web Designers by Jeremy Keith of A Book Apart.

The cool thing about this book is that I was able to get it on store credit at [McKay](http://mckaybooks.com/locations/nashville/), Nashville's best used book store.  If you've ever looked for used books on technology, you know that most of them are over ten years old and haven't been relevant for almost that long, so a modern book like this was a great find.

This is a really easy and quick read.  It's a pretty thin book and I was able to breeze through it in the course of a couple of days.  It's a very basic overview of what you can do with HTML5, so I wouldn't expect anything as expansive and heavy as the 900 page HTML5 spec, which is probably a good thing considering that it's not fun or easy to read something that long.

You get a taste of everything from video and audio and their current limitations to the canvas and the new HTML5 input types and attributes.  This book made me excited to be in the web development space because there is so much growth happening and there is sure to be a lot more to come soon.  It wasn't terribly heavy on JavaScript, which is always disappointing to me, but there are some examples of how to accomplish backwards compatibility for native HTML5 behavior using my favorite scripting language.

I would recommend this book to any front-end developer wanting to cut their teeth on some more cutting-edge experiences.  It made me want to go out and write a JavaScript library to ensure backwards compatibility so we can use more HTML5 form types now, and in my book, anything that makes me want to write JavaScript was worth my time.  Unfortunately, that means that everything is worth my time.
