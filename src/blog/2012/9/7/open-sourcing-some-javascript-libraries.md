I've been working on several projects in the past year or so that have required me to write some jQuery plugins and custom JavaScript widgets and I feel like several of them could definitely be useful for other developers.  I've set a goal this year to release at least two projects to the community, but it's tough to know which ones people will find most useful. Since it takes a little work to get a library to a place where it works under multiple scenarios and that's even before the lengthy process of writing documentation, I thought I'd put it up to a vote to see what people would like to see and use.  Whatever seems to have the most positive attention is what I'll probably end up open-sourcing first.

Here are some of the things I've done that might make good open-source projects:

- A minimal MVC Framework
- An HTML5 line chart graphing library.  [My company](http://moontoast.com) is probably going to give me some time to get this done during the day, so you'll probably see it either way.
- A jQuery HTML5 audio plugin with a complete flash fallback
- A JavaScript loader that loads JavaScript and CSS into the DOM using JavaScript build files. It allows you to pass the mode into the query string to either serve up the compressed / minified file, the individual development files or to throw an alert with the code you would need to paste into the terminal to minify the files using YUI
- A basic coverflow jQuery plugin

Those are all the ones I can think of at the moment.  Is there any interest in seeing one or more of those?  Just leave a comment and let me know.
