I've been using a standup desk for nearly a year now.  It all started when I discovered [this infographic](http://dailyinfographic.com/the-harm-of-sitting-constantly-infographic).

Up until last week, I was working at [Moontoast](http://moontoast.com) where I had set my Ikea desk on top of four cinder blocks to make it standing level. This week, I started working at [appendTo](http://appendto.com), which means that I'm finally able to work from home.

I knew that I wanted to keep working standing up and I also knew that propping our desk up on cinder blocks would probably be an eyesore in the guest bedroom. I looked around a little bit and found [this design](http://opensoul.org/blog/archives/2012/01/09/the-40-standup-desk/) which was perfect for my space.

I was able to install the desk for under $40 in less than two hours. So far it has been perfect for my needs although I am brainstorming some ways to make my monitors more eye-level so I don't need to look down, which can be bad for your shoulders and upper-back. I think 4 to 6 inches higher would be perfect.
