If you haven't used [ko.ninja](https://github.com/jcreamer898/ko.ninja) yet, it is a great little framework for building awesome Knockout applications.

I've built a sample app to show how easy it is to build something with Ninja. The application is based off of Conway's Game of Life, which was devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The idea is that each cell either lives, dies or multiplies based on the cells around it as you proceed from one step to the next. You can even set up a pattern to start with and push play and let the game take over.

My plan is to maintain this app as ko.ninja develops to use the latest advances and show how to create a well-structured application using ko.ninja.
