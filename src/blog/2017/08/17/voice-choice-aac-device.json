My son will be 6 this October and he is still completely non-verbal. This is not the case for everyone with autism, but it is the shape of autism that we know. Over the past four years, we have been searching for ways for our son to be able to communicate with us. We've tried several different augmentative and alternative communication devices and iPad apps, but they have all been too complicated to get started on. We needed something simpler. That's when it struck me. I am a programmer. If the product that we need doesn't exist, I can make it. And so began my journey creating Voice Choice.",
