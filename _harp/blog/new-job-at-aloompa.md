### Goodbye to AppendTo :(

Over the past two years, I have been working at [appendTo](http://appendto.com). AppendTo is an awesome company that focuses on consulting, training and custom development for web and mobile applications. One thing that sets appendTo apart is that they are a 100% remote organization with no home office. 

While I've been at appendTo, I've worked with some of the best JavaScript developers in the world. At appendTo, I've learned, developed and grown more than in any other time in my life. I have made many great friends and I have experienced many great animated gifs in our company [Slack](http://slack.io) chat rooms.

### Hello to Aloompa :)

Aloompa is a company based here in Nashville that primarily focuses on facilitating native apps for festivals like [Bonnaroo](http://www.bonnaroo.com/) and the [CMA festival](http://www.cmaworld.com/cma-music-festival/). They have an awesome team and a really cool product that I'm excited to be a part of.

I know this is weird to say, but I can't wait to start working on Monday!
