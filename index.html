This has always been an ideal to reach for, but their focus on unidirectional data-flow has forced me to rethink the way I structure my code in a really positive way. It&#39;s no wonder that even Angular 2.0 is using a similar component-based architecture for rendering UI. It just makes sense! Today, I&#39;m going to walk through how I have been organizing my components. This approach makes each module easy to find when I need it.</p>

Lest you think that this is a useless part of the ES6 spec, let me show you some examples of how destructuring can be used in a JavaScript application.</p>

              <div class="teaser"><p>With v0.13 of React, we got native support for using ES6 classes. This may not seem like a huge deal since ES6 classes are basically just syntactical sugar over the more laborious inheritance of yesteryears JavaScript. However, it is clear that there was a problem since practically every framework or helper library added their own kind of classical inheritance, often with a different implementation. The unified class syntax for ES6 gives us an easy way to do inheritance that will one day be native to every browser and JavaScript engine. Looking forward to the future, React now gives us the ability to call React.Component as a native class.</p>

When it comes to a community largely driven by open-source developers, it&#39;s hard to predict what the JavaScript landscape will look like in 2015. There could be a new library or framework that gets released tomorrow that literally changes everything. However, judging by the 2014 landscape, I have put together a few predictions for 2015.</p>

If you aren&#39;t careful, you can make some pretty ugly nested code in order to get things to work like you expect. To solve the problem of illegible nested callbacks, we have promises. If you are writing applications in Angular, you are in luck because Angular ships with a great promise library called &quot;Q&quot;. Today, we&#39;re going to look at a few approaches to making more readable and maintainable Angular applications with the help of the built in Q promise library.</p>

              <div class="teaser"><p>At the ng-europe conference in Paris this year, the Angular team made several revelations about what Angular 2.0 will look like once it is complete. Several of the current features of Angular will be put to rest, but one of the more notable ones is the controller <code>$scope</code>. As developers prepare to eventually migrate their applications to Angular 2.0, it is important to do what we can currently in order to prepare for the easiest migration. One thing we already know we can do is to stop using the angular $scope entirely in our controllers. This is how you can do exactly that.</p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve gotten our server-side API set up, we can us it to get data into the Angular portion of our application.

<p>As I promised at the beginning of this series, we are going to be using <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> to manage our client-side modules. If you haven&#39;t used RequireJS or a similar AMD loader before, let me just say that you are really missing out. RequireJS lets you write your code in small modules that only expose the parts of the API that you want to show and as an added bonus, it uses JavaScript to load your JavaScript modules.</p>

<p>Sails JS is a really cool framework for building realtime web applications. Today I am going to show you how easy it is to create a new Sails project. In many ways, Sails is similar to Ruby On Rails. It allows you to create a new application and sets enough defaults that you can run it right away.</p>

<p>I only recently started playing around with Sails, and I wanted to add a unit testing suite to the application I was working on. I searched for other people who were doing test driven development in Sails, but I wasn&#39;t satisfied with the results. As it turns out, getting tests in place for Sails was one of the easier things I&#39;ve done in my life and I was able to get a few unit tests running withing 30 minutes of sitting down to do it.</p>

<p>With a little bit of working knowledge, it&#39;s really not hard to make some nice looking CSS3 animations, and that is what we are going to do today. If you have ever studied animation, you probably know that one of the first things you need to learn is how to do squash, stretch and bounce, which are the cornerstones of exaggerated animation physics. Today, I&#39;m going to walk you through how you can handle those basics just using CSS3.</p>

There are several Pub/Sub libraries that have emerged to solve that problem. Some of the main contenders are <a href="https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS">PubSubJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/postaljs/postal.js">Postal</a> and <a href="http://amplifyjs.com/">Amplify</a>.</p>
<p>With several options to chose from, there is certainly value in abstracting away whichever choice you make so that you could easily switch the Pub/Sub library out without impacting the application. There are various reasons for switching libraries. Your library of choice might become unmaintained, or perhaps it will evolve in a way that doesn&#39;t suite your needs, or perhaps a better solution will emerge. Whatever the case, you certainly don&#39;t want to be locked in and have to change every file of your application if you do make the choice to switch at some point. Additionally, if you are using an AMD loader, you get the added benefit of not needing to require the pub/sub library in every module that uses it. This is how I have gone about abstracting my pub/sub libraries in applications in the past.</p>

I have recently been dabbling with <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three JS</a>, which is a JavaScript engine for creating 3D models and animations for the browser.</p>
<p>Of course, my interests go beyond just making games and website animations. I like that the engine is written in JavaScript and that it uses web technologies like the canvas and WebGL to render the models. To that end, I have been exploring ways to export animations I make with Three JS to an external video file that I could use to stitch together actual films just like any application-based 3D animation software like Maya, Blender or Lightwave. I know it&#39;s crazy, but I think this might actually work.</p>

Many blog posts have sprung up about how to do common things that are typically done with jQuery just using vanilla JavaScript. While it is important to know where jQuery is needed and where a leaner solution could provide a quicker load time and less complexity, for most large-scale projects, the last thing you want to be worrying about is optimizing against various browser types and nuances.</p>
<p>Reactive frameworks such as Knockout may seem on the surface to work pretty well without needing jQuery at all, but as you get deeper into complex interfaces, you might find yourself needing something such as a jQuery UI component. So where should jQuery and DOM interaction go in a well-structured Knockout application?</p>

All I had to do was directly modify elements in the DOM and they would instantly react. But that was in the late 90s and early 2000s, now I have found reasons for abstracting away DOM interaction. That&#39;s not to say that DOM manipulation shouldn&#39;t happen, it just shouldn&#39;t be the glue that holds your application together.</p>

Today we are going to look a little deeper and explore how data works in Meteor. If that isn&#39;t enough to get you excited, let me give you a teaser - Meteor literally lets you save data on the client-side without having to deal with the internals of server-side code. Have I got your attention yet?</p>

Already having your tests in place informs your software design decisions and serves as a way to determine whether your code is accomplishing what it is supposed to. The benefits of TDD are obvious, so why is it so hard to approach writing software this way?</p>

That is where <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> comes in.

The laws of supply and demand work in the developer&#39;s favor since all of the companies are forced to compete for the limited number of people who can write code well.</p>

<p>Up until last week, I was working at <a href="http://moontoast.com">Moontoast</a> where I had set my Ikea desk on top of four cinder blocks to make it standing level.

I&#39;ve set a goal this year to release at least two projects to the community, but it&#39;s tough to know which ones people will find most useful. Since it takes a little work to get a library to a place where it works under multiple scenarios and that&#39;s even before the lengthy process of writing documentation, I thought I&#39;d put it up to a vote to see what people would like to see and use.  Whatever seems to have the most positive attention is what I&#39;ll probably end up open-sourcing first.</p>

One of the keys to writing an application that fits the bill is to use reusable components that, instead of calling other functions or components directly, broadcast events that multiple components may be listening for.  I&#39;ve been on a hunt to figure out how to do this correctly for a while now and I&#39;ve finally come upon a few good solutions.</p>

The fact is that users don&#39;t like waiting on your page to load, and the more you can do to keep from reloading the whole thing, the better.

It was extremely large in scale and scope and it quickly became clear that I was going to have to have some sort of organizational structure to build the application upon.  My server-side experience at this point was primarily in writing C#, and I had fallen in love with the organization of the .NET MVC design pattern.  From there, I had been doing some contract work using CakePHP, which is also an MVC framework.  While I had written JavaScript for my websites, an entire application is completely different.  I looked around at frameworks and eventually settled on <a href="http://javascriptmvc.com">JavaScript MVC</a> for its basis in the MVC framework as well as its rich feature set.  So what does JavascriptMVC come with &quot;out of the box?&quot;</p>

Whereas websites used to have only a couple of lines of Javascript code used in them, Javascript has evolved to a point where it often does a large part of the heavy lifting in Internet Application development.  With the evolution of Javascript, the code typically used on a site can often grow to a point where it is bulky hard to maintain if it is not properly constructed.  That&#39;s why the topic for today is on how to architect Javascript in such a way to make it easy to maintain. Javascript is a programming language, after all, so we should treat it with the same care and respect we would treat server-side code.</p>

My goal through this blog is to tackle some of the relevant issues pertaining to web usability, and user experience as well as sharing some client-side and possibly a little bit of server-side code that can help other people who are trying to create user friendly websites.  Since that is my ultimate purpose here, I feel like I need to lay some groundwork by explaining what User Experience Design and what User Interface Development actually entail.  This is just laying down the tracks for some more in-depth discussion down the road, but we&#39;ve got to start somewhere, right?  Let&#39;s jump into it.</p>
