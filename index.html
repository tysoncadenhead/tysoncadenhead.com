Previously, we looked at how we can automatically save ko.ninja data with ajax, but today we&#39;re going to look at how to use Socket.io with ko.ninja. Since I love socket.io so much, I had to include it as one of our model options in ko.ninja. This is not a primer on how to use socket.io, so if you haven&#39;t used it before, I suggest checking out my blog post on <a href="/blog/getting-started-with-socket-io">getting started with socket.io</a>.</p>

        <p>This is a part of a larger series about the <a href="/blog/ko-ninja">ko.ninja framework</a> that I helped to create to make Knockout development more awesome. With ko.ninja, you can add a model to your viewModel to automatically save your data as soon as it changes and validates. Ko.ninja comes with several model types including localStorage, ajax and socket.io, but we also plan to add the ability to let you define a custom model type if you have other needs that are not covered by our model types.</p>

        <p>Over the past year, I have been doing a ton of work on Knockout applications. There is a lot to love about Knockout. The declarative bindings allow you to keep your UI data-driven and synced at all times, which is a huge win when you are working on large scalable applications. However, one place where the Knockout core is lacking is that it is not prescriptive about how code should be written for it. That was the beginning of the idea behind ko.ninja. If we could put some structure around our viewModels, we could do some really cool things.</p>

There are plenty of hackers out there who would love to get their hands on your data. But perhaps the most disturbing recent revelation about data collection has been the extent to which the NSA is actively gathering our personal information.</p>

        <p>Authentication can be something of a road-blocker in application development. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve had a great idea for an app, but instead of jumping in and writing the core functionality, I try to tackle the authentication layer first. The problem is that once I&#39;ve gotten authentication in place, my excitement for the project has faded because I wasn&#39;t working on the project itself, just trying to set up a login system. Meteor takes the work out of setting up authentication so that you can focus on more important things, like writing the core functionality for your app.</p>

        <p>In the old days, if you wanted to get up-to-date data from the sever, you would need to set an interval on the client-side and continuously make Ajax calls to see if new data was available. The problem is that the data was never exactly real time. It was just what had been fetched every fifteen seconds or so. If you pinged the server too often, you would create needless overhead and there may or may not even be new data for the client to consume. The problems with this sort of approach are obvious.</p>

        <p>Test driven development (or TDD for short) is the practice of writing your unit tests prior to writing the code for your application. Already having your tests in place informs your software design decisions and serves as a way to determine whether your code is accomplishing what it is supposed to. The benefits of TDD are obvious, so why is it so hard to approach writing software this way?</p>

        <p>When it comes to building applications quickly that share a ton of code between the client-side and server-side and that excel at real-time communication, there is nothing more awesome than Meteor. Meteor aims to remove all of the busywork from creating single-page applications, and it does a heck of a job at it.</p>

        <p>One way to reduce the loading time of your website or application is to merge multiple images together into one large sprite. The benefit is that only one http request has to be made instead of multiple requests. Of course, managing a sprite image and the CSS that uses it can be a pain in the neck. That is where <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> comes in. Compass has a really cool helper that lets you import an entire folder of images and that it will automatically sprite for you.</p>

        <p>Sublime Text is a really great editor for writing code. It is actually my editor of choice at the moment. One nice feature that comes with Sublime is the ability to specify a custom build type. Sublime comes with several built-in build systems, but I&#39;ve recently discovered that rolling my own build system is really simple. Here is how I got Sublime to build my JavaScript and Node scripts using Grunt.</p>

Grunt is really great about automating tasks that would have been very tedious otherwise. One great thing about Grunt is the ability to run <code>grunt watch</code> to monitor your files and run tasks when they are changed. We can use <code>grunt watch</code> in tandem with compass to automatically compile css files on the fly as we change our SASS files.</p>

        <p>Sometimes when you are developing applications, it can be handy to know how long it takes for an operation to complete. For example, you might want to know how long an element takes to render or how long it takes for an Ajax call to resolve. Luckily, most of the modern web browsers have a <code>console.time</code> function that makes that easier.</p>

        <p>Knowing what parts of your code to test can sometimes be tricky. If you have a large application, it can be challenging to know what has already been tested and what still needs testing. That is why the world needs JSCover.</p>

<p>The answer I finally discovered was <a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever">Forever</a>. Forever is a CLI tool that keeps a node process running indefinitely. That means that you can ssh into the place where your code is hosted, start the server with Forever and then close your ssh connection and the server will still be running. It is a thing of beauty.</p>

        <p>The release of Node.js in 2009 ushered in discussions about the endless possibilities for sharing code between the client-side and the server side. While there are several good examples of entire libraries working very well on both ends, most of the projects that are written in Node tend to shy away from sharing the meat of the application with the browser. I think that the real issue is developers being stuck in our ways. We are trying to write traditional web apps in a language that can actually go beyond what traditional scripting languages were even capable of.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is different from other programming languages because it is asynchronous. That means that there is a possibility that several things can be happening at the same time. In other words, JavaScript doesn&#39;t wait for one thing to execute before going to the next. If you are waiting for a timeout to fire, or a response from an Ajax call or a database transaction, while the process completes, JavaScript silently moves on.</p>

This week, I started working at <a href="http://appendto.com">appendTo</a>, which means that I&#39;m finally able to work from home.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve recently been working on a JavaScript API that interfaces with a REST-based server-side API and handles cross-domain issues while still allowing GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods to be fired from anywhere on the web.  Due to cross-domain security issues at the browser level, making POST, PUT and DELETE requests can be a lot harder than you might think.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve been working on several projects in the past year or so that have required me to write some jQuery plugins and custom JavaScript widgets and I feel like several of them could definitely be useful for other developers.  I&#39;ve set a goal this year to release at least two projects to the community, but it&#39;s tough to know which ones people will find most useful. Since it takes a little work to get a library to a place where it works under multiple scenarios and that&#39;s even before the lengthy process of writing documentation, I thought I&#39;d put it up to a vote to see what people would like to see and use.  Whatever seems to have the most positive attention is what I&#39;ll probably end up open-sourcing first.</p>

        <p>Most of us can agree that spawning popups with JavaScript is usually a user experience FAIL.  We&#39;ve all been to websites that opened several popup ads. That is always something to avoid.  Malicious and ad-happy sites have made it necessary for browser plugins and some browsers to block JavaScript popups altogether.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is a loosely-typed case sensitive language.  Technically everything in the language is a variable.  Yes, it may be a string, a function, an array or an object, but everything is a variable at its core.  Because you can make your variables all lowercase or all uppercase or anywhere in between, it’s important for the sake of code readability to have a pattern for how the variables will be cased.</p>

        <p>If you&#39;re like me, you are constantly looking for better ways to architect your JavaScript applications to be scalable and modular.  One of the keys to writing an application that fits the bill is to use reusable components that, instead of calling other functions or components directly, broadcast events that multiple components may be listening for.  I&#39;ve been on a hunt to figure out how to do this correctly for a while now and I&#39;ve finally come upon a few good solutions.</p>

        <p>Ajax is awesome for things like rich internet applications that don&#39;t require SEO because of their internal nature, or for on-page events like form validation and submitting, but from an SEO standpoint, adding content to the DOM is illegible. But you still want the increased usability of not having to reload the page every time an element or two is changed, right?  The fact is that users don&#39;t like waiting on your page to load, and the more you can do to keep from reloading the whole thing, the better.  But still, there&#39;s the problem of JavaScript DOM manipulation not jiving with Search Engine Optimization.  What&#39;s a person to do?</p>

        <p>Nearly a year ago I was working for a company in the financial services industry that had need for a scalable, secure, AJAX application.  It was extremely large in scale and scope and it quickly became clear that I was going to have to have some sort of organizational structure to build the application upon.  My server-side experience at this point was primarily in writing C#, and I had fallen in love with the organization of the .NET MVC design pattern.  From there, I had been doing some contract work using CakePHP, which is also an MVC framework.  While I had written JavaScript for my websites, an entire application is completely different.  I looked around at frameworks and eventually settled on <a href="http://javascriptmvc.com">JavaScript MVC</a> for its basis in the MVC framework as well as its rich feature set.  So what does JavascriptMVC come with &quot;out of the box?&quot;</p>

        <p>As the web has grown, the Javascript programming language has grown with it to become rich and robust.  Whereas websites used to have only a couple of lines of Javascript code used in them, Javascript has evolved to a point where it often does a large part of the heavy lifting in Internet Application development.  With the evolution of Javascript, the code typically used on a site can often grow to a point where it is bulky hard to maintain if it is not properly constructed.  That&#39;s why the topic for today is on how to architect Javascript in such a way to make it easy to maintain. Javascript is a programming language, after all, so we should treat it with the same care and respect we would treat server-side code.</p>

        <p>If I haven&#39;t said this before, I am seriously planning on showing more code in some of my post in the near future.  This one is slightly related to my previous blog entry, <a href="/blog/what-is-user-experience-user-interface/">What is UI / UX?</a> but I will be more focused because I&#39;m just going to be talking about how links relate to user experience on websites.  First, we&#39;ll take a history lesson.</p>

        <p>When I tell people that I&#39;m a User Experience / User Interface Developer, I tend to get a mixture of people who say &quot;you make website, I can&#39;t event check my e-mail&quot; and people who aren&#39;t exactly sure what it means to be a user experience designer.  My goal through this blog is to tackle some of the relevant issues pertaining to web usability, and user experience as well as sharing some client-side and possibly a little bit of server-side code that can help other people who are trying to create user friendly websites.  Since that is my ultimate purpose here, I feel like I need to lay some groundwork by explaining what User Experience Design and what User Interface Development actually entail.  This is just laying down the tracks for some more in-depth discussion down the road, but we&#39;ve got to start somewhere, right?  Let&#39;s jump into it.</p>

        <p>SEO has been a hot topic especially in the last few years as the number of websites on the Internet has increased and being easily found on most search engines has been increasingly difficult. Everyone who has a website is looking for ways to make their site more accessible to Google and other modern search tools, so what are the basics? How can you take your website and bump it up in search engine rankings? Here are some clues.</p>

        <p>A couple of years ago, if you had asked me what my take on design patterns for internet applications was, I would have probably given you a blank, questioning stare.  You see, as sad as it is, proper design and architectural patterns aren&#39;t exactly the norm in the web development world.  Today, I&#39;m going to give you a quick overview on what architectural design patterns are and why they&#39;re important and then focus in on MVC.</p>

        <p>Microsoft released Internet Explorer 6 nearly eight years ago in August of 2001. Since then, they have released two new versions of their web browser, IE7 and IE8 and have officially stopped supporting the outdated cousin, IE6. So why is it that most web developers are still supporting a browser that even Microsoft itself has turned its back on?</p>
