Just wrap the code that you want to execute last in an <code>_.defer()</code> method and it will wait until everything on the current call stack has completed and then execute your desired code. Problem solved. Or was it?</p>

The interesting thing about React components is that they are a container for a combination of state and rendering logic. This should make them easier to test than most view layers in other frameworks because we can easily change the state of a component and make assertions based on what we expect the state changes to do to modify the rendered output.</p>

It&#39;s no wonder that even Angular 2.0 is using a similar component-based architecture for rendering UI. It just makes sense! Today, I&#39;m going to walk through how I have been organizing my components. This approach makes each module easy to find when I need it.</p>

              <div class="teaser"><p>With v0.13 of React, we got native support for using ES6 classes. This may not seem like a huge deal since ES6 classes are basically just syntactical sugar over the more laborious inheritance of yesteryears JavaScript. However, it is clear that there was a problem since practically every framework or helper library added their own kind of classical inheritance, often with a different implementation. The unified class syntax for ES6 gives us an easy way to do inheritance that will one day be native to every browser and JavaScript engine. Looking forward to the future, React now gives us the ability to call React.Component as a native class.</p>

There could be a new library or framework that gets released tomorrow that literally changes everything. However, judging by the 2014 landscape, I have put together a few predictions for 2015.</p>

If you aren&#39;t careful, you can make some pretty ugly nested code in order to get things to work like you expect. To solve the problem of illegible nested callbacks, we have promises. If you are writing applications in Angular, you are in luck because Angular ships with a great promise library called &quot;Q&quot;. Today, we&#39;re going to look at a few approaches to making more readable and maintainable Angular applications with the help of the built in Q promise library.</p>

One thing we already know we can do is to stop using the angular $scope entirely in our controllers. This is how you can do exactly that.</p>

<p>As I promised at the beginning of this series, we are going to be using <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> to manage our client-side modules. If you haven&#39;t used RequireJS or a similar AMD loader before, let me just say that you are really missing out. RequireJS lets you write your code in small modules that only expose the parts of the API that you want to show and as an added bonus, it uses JavaScript to load your JavaScript modules.</p>

<p>Sails JS is a really cool framework for building realtime web applications. Today I am going to show you how easy it is to create a new Sails project. In many ways, Sails is similar to Ruby On Rails. It allows you to create a new application and sets enough defaults that you can run it right away.</p>

There are a ton of moving pieces and you want to make sure that your user model is up to the task of consuming any type of authentication you throw at it. To that end, I recently set up Facebook authentication on a Sails.js app I&#39;m working on and I thought it might be worth sharing how easy it actually turned out to be.</p>

              <div class="teaser"><p>In my opinion, <a href="http://sailsjs.org/">Sails</a> is one of the best Node MVC frameworks out there. It provides a really clean architecture and is completely customizable. The Socket.io integration also gives it an edge over many of the competitors.</p>
<p>I only recently started playing around with Sails, and I wanted to add a unit testing suite to the application I was working on. I searched for other people who were doing test driven development in Sails, but I wasn&#39;t satisfied with the results. As it turns out, getting tests in place for Sails was one of the easier things I&#39;ve done in my life and I was able to get a few unit tests running withing 30 minutes of sitting down to do it.</p>

There are several benefits to taking this approach. First of all, I can host the site using any server environment. When I build it, all that I have are HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and they can be hosted with Node, Apache, IIS or any other server. Another benefit is that there are several places where I can host my blog for free.</p>
<p>I ended up choosing to go with Github pages because this is a web development blog and I thought it was well-suited for their platform. This is how I got it working.</p>

              <div class="teaser"><p>One of the best parts of CSS3 is the ability to do keyframe animation. Once upon a time, if you wanted to animate DOM elements in the browser, you had to do it with JavaScript. CSS3 animations are generally smoother and perform better than moving elements around with JavaScript. They also do really well on mobile devices.</p>
<p>With a little bit of working knowledge, it&#39;s really not hard to make some nice looking CSS3 animations, and that is what we are going to do today. If you have ever studied animation, you probably know that one of the first things you need to learn is how to do squash, stretch and bounce, which are the cornerstones of exaggerated animation physics. Today, I&#39;m going to walk you through how you can handle those basics just using CSS3.</p>

              <div class="teaser"><p>If you have worked on a large scalable web application, I probably don&#39;t have to tell you how important it is to keep your modules from directly referencing each other. There are several Pub/Sub libraries that have emerged to solve that problem. Some of the main contenders are <a href="https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS">PubSubJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/postaljs/postal.js">Postal</a> and <a href="http://amplifyjs.com/">Amplify</a>.</p>
<p>With several options to chose from, there is certainly value in abstracting away whichever choice you make so that you could easily switch the Pub/Sub library out without impacting the application. There are various reasons for switching libraries. Your library of choice might become unmaintained, or perhaps it will evolve in a way that doesn&#39;t suite your needs, or perhaps a better solution will emerge. Whatever the case, you certainly don&#39;t want to be locked in and have to change every file of your application if you do make the choice to switch at some point. Additionally, if you are using an AMD loader, you get the added benefit of not needing to require the pub/sub library in every module that uses it. This is how I have gone about abstracting my pub/sub libraries in applications in the past.</p>

I have recently been dabbling with <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three JS</a>, which is a JavaScript engine for creating 3D models and animations for the browser.</p>
<p>Of course, my interests go beyond just making games and website animations. I like that the engine is written in JavaScript and that it uses web technologies like the canvas and WebGL to render the models. To that end, I have been exploring ways to export animations I make with Three JS to an external video file that I could use to stitch together actual films just like any application-based 3D animation software like Maya, Blender or Lightwave. I know it&#39;s crazy, but I think this might actually work.</p>

              <div class="teaser"><p>There has been a lot of buzz around whether or not jQuery is needed for building web applications anymore. Many blog posts have sprung up about how to do common things that are typically done with jQuery just using vanilla JavaScript. While it is important to know where jQuery is needed and where a leaner solution could provide a quicker load time and less complexity, for most large-scale projects, the last thing you want to be worrying about is optimizing against various browser types and nuances.</p>
<p>Reactive frameworks such as Knockout may seem on the surface to work pretty well without needing jQuery at all, but as you get deeper into complex interfaces, you might find yourself needing something such as a jQuery UI component. So where should jQuery and DOM interaction go in a well-structured Knockout application?</p>

All I had to do was directly modify elements in the DOM and they would instantly react. But that was in the late 90s and early 2000s, now I have found reasons for abstracting away DOM interaction. That&#39;s not to say that DOM manipulation shouldn&#39;t happen, it just shouldn&#39;t be the glue that holds your application together.</p>

The declarative bindings allow you to keep your UI data-driven and synced at all times, which is a huge win when you are working on large scalable applications. However, one place where the Knockout core is lacking is that it is not prescriptive about how code should be written for it. That was the beginning of the idea behind ko.ninja. If we could put some structure around our viewModels, we could do some really cool things.</p>

I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve had a great idea for an app, but instead of jumping in and writing the core functionality, I try to tackle the authentication layer first. The problem is that once I&#39;ve gotten authentication in place, my excitement for the project has faded because I wasn&#39;t working on the project itself, just trying to set up a login system. Meteor takes the work out of setting up authentication so that you can focus on more important things, like writing the core functionality for your app.</p>

We were working against time to get an application finished before the dwindling money supply was depleted. In the end, we were not able to meet our mark. However, during my time there, I became known as &quot;the Machine&quot; because of my intent focus on our work.</p>

While there are several good examples of entire libraries working very well on both ends, most of the projects that are written in Node tend to shy away from sharing the meat of the application with the browser. I think that the real issue is developers being stuck in our ways. We are trying to write traditional web apps in a language that can actually go beyond what traditional scripting languages were even capable of.</p>

That means that there is a possibility that several things can be happening at the same time. In other words, JavaScript doesn&#39;t wait for one thing to execute before going to the next. If you are waiting for a timeout to fire, or a response from an Ajax call or a database transaction, while the process completes, JavaScript silently moves on.</p>

Since it takes a little work to get a library to a place where it works under multiple scenarios and that&#39;s even before the lengthy process of writing documentation, I thought I&#39;d put it up to a vote to see what people would like to see and use.

Yes, it may be a string, a function, an array or an object, but everything is a variable at its core.  Because you can make your variables all lowercase or all uppercase or anywhere in between, it’s important for the sake of code readability to have a pattern for how the variables will be cased.</p>

It was extremely large in scale and scope and it quickly became clear that I was going to have to have some sort of organizational structure to build the application upon.  My server-side experience at this point was primarily in writing C#, and I had fallen in love with the organization of the .NET MVC design pattern.  From there, I had been doing some contract work using CakePHP, which is also an MVC framework.  While I had written JavaScript for my websites, an entire application is completely different.  I looked around at frameworks and eventually settled on <a href="http://javascriptmvc.com">JavaScript MVC</a> for its basis in the MVC framework as well as its rich feature set.  So what does JavascriptMVC come with &quot;out of the box?&quot;</p>

Whereas websites used to have only a couple of lines of Javascript code used in them, Javascript has evolved to a point where it often does a large part of the heavy lifting in Internet Application development.  With the evolution of Javascript, the code typically used on a site can often grow to a point where it is bulky hard to maintain if it is not properly constructed.  That&#39;s why the topic for today is on how to architect Javascript in such a way to make it easy to maintain. Javascript is a programming language, after all, so we should treat it with the same care and respect we would treat server-side code.</p>

Since then, they have released two new versions of their web browser, IE7 and IE8 and have officially stopped supporting the outdated cousin, IE6.
